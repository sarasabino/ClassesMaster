a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't
handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.

When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation

Well... all the way through a decreasing-radius corner, anyway...


OK (but I'm right!)  :^)


If that's the ""official line"" taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have to
question the quality of the classes.  The ""official line"" in MSF
curricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying
both brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and
both tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to
prevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more
traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to
weight shift.

The ""official line"" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face
of it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage
of all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the
available braking power by using only the front at time 0.


Not necessarily true.  ""Chirping"" the tire indicates impending lockup
(on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate
maximum braking.  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally
makes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an
experienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like
Code used to use.


True, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills
(which is how this discussion started), ""keep both wheels just on the
point of sliding"" is nearly useless information.  You need to teach a
*technique*, or at least a strategy, to achieve this.

No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs
the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the
CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive
controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers
tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits,
IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.



Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't
an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller
board which handles all of these commands.

The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are
intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the
CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor
to transfer their data.




The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the 
devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business.
Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the
data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will
also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore
allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept
as dettach/callback.  

Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?

What you want are Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and Plastic
Cleaner. They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from
plastic. For fine scratches just use the Polish, for bigger ones start
with the Cleaner and finish with the Polish. The stuff is $5-8 bucks per
bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores. Don't choke over the
price too much, since both bottles will probably last you 10 years. The

the Highway Patrol took a few of the opposition Senators out and gave
them some shots, and when they hit .07, put them on a course dodging
cones.  They failed, and will probably change their votes as a result.

For some bizarre reason, NC is the only state where the governer has no
veto power over legislation coming out of the state Congress, so his
opinion on the matter is moot.

For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel
for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the
contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be
worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest
heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I
don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.

But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a
low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General
Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two
unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. 
Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9
billion for the US share.

I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that
its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric
tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew
habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for
the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be
able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,
that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors
eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or
college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round
this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton
payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two
LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a
year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of
delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone
have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and
equipment would weigh?

And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded
to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? 
Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10
engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? 
I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
DC-1.

All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the
moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first
non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned
moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find
some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal
might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary
about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd
like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.

Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an
English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on
the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar
flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses
in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.

1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force
air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake
valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only
the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after
the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the
intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing
atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time
does the pressure ever become ""negative"", or even approach a good
vacuum.

2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the
combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up
to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume
of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume
that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature
difference and the products of combustion.

3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started
paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty
horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,
substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost
zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very
well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make
very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is
_much_ louder than the stocker.

4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.
If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference
was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.

5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any
given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it
on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.
Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.

"My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding
jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.

I'm considering two basic options:

1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.
    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.

2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new 
    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey
    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper
    than upper Aerostich.

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out 
lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, 
shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would 
be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...

Actually, the situation is even worse than that.  The *total mass* of the
Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds, and most of that is
support equipment like power and communications.  The mass available for
instruments is maybe 10% of that.  I don't think a BATSE will fit...

Actually, would you need the shielding?  My understanding is that it's
mostly there to give the detectors some directionality.  No point in
doing that if you've only got one.  I'm sure the burst detectors that
have flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much.
(Mind you, they're probably still too heavy -- the PFF people would put
more Pluto-specific instruments on first, if they had any mass to spare.)",actually situation even bad total mass pluto fast flyby spacecraft 250ish pound support equipment like power communication mass available instrument maybe 10 not think batse fit actually would need shielding understanding mostly give detector directionality point get one sure burst detector fly deepspace mission not weigh much mind probably still heavy pff people would put plutospecific instrument first mass spare,2,sci.space

Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction
of the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to
the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the
acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this
case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  

The record for acceleration, though, is measured along ""the direction
you're facing"" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record
was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.",actually number correct difference direction acceleration pilot acceleration tend transverse direction face pull steep dive acceleration force blood toward foot instance case put 8 g even pressure suit record acceleration though measure along direction face lack well term recall record set rocket sled back 60 40 g,2,sci.space

I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the
software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically
correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking
care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited
the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He
also noted that the software people were starting to feel management
pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)

Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things
right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure
during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.
As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted
on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.

As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.
Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the
experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate 
onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh 
envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. 

You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. 
It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, 
the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. 
That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure 
stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions
(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make 
a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. 

The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur
does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the 
cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be 
done there........



The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it 
lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses 
for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they 
use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's 
do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems 
could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with 
providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill 
this idea.

The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version
was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used
today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)
orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is
the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir),
as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit
under the shroud.

REGUARDLESS of whether it is a Mac or a PC SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 are DIFFERENT
from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous SCSI-1.  All of these
have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS. Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is
dumb and sloppy.  Take again the quote later on as an example of the problem 
in the PC world {The spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were
coming from in the article.  It shows the article is CORRECT in it
staments about SCSI but not CONSITANT}.

With the way this thread has gone how do you tell :-).
Already GAVE them.  YOU keep deleting them! So here are the Specs
on everybody AGAIN {With some added info}:

SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s
 synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is
 mainly in software not hardware.

SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with 
10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the
 PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}

{I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
 asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}
 synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s.

Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true
a Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software.
And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY 
CANNOT WE?


With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with
SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.}
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: 
(My comments in {})
""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with
a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with 
a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29
The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use
NOT because the interface itself is a mess.

SCSI means ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.

To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as

BIOS SETTINGS

BIOS setting for the M2614ET in my system is 667 cylinders, 33 sectors
and 16 heads.




MODEL      CYLINDERS   HEADS    SECTORS   CAPACITY (Million bytes)

M2622T      1013        10        63         326.75

M2624T      995         16        63         513.51


There are 6 switches on the switch block on these drives.  Only 4 of 
them have a use that I am aware of (from my M2624T manual):

Master/Slave        Master (*)      SW1-5 OFF
                    Slave           SW1-5 ON
ECC bytes           4 bytes (*)     SW1-4 OFF
                    7 bytes         SW1-4 ON
Write Protect       Disabled (*)    SW1-3 OFF
                    Enabled         SW1-3 ON
IO Channel Ready    Disabled (*)    SW1-1 OFF
                    Enabled         SW1-1 ON

I have no idea about the function of SW1-2 and SW1-6.  The values 
listed with a (*) are the factory default settings.

There are two sets of jumpers. A set of 5 and a set of
4. With the power and IDE connector toward you, the set of 5 is
numbered (left to right) J16 - J20  , and the set of 4 is numbered
(bottom to top) J22-J25. 

The only jumper of normal interest is J20. Jumper it for only
drive in a single drive system, or master drive in a dual drive
system.
 
Remove the jumper J20 for slave drive in a dual drive system. 

J19 is a dummy and may be used to store the spare shunt if the 
drive is configured for a slave mode.

Jumpers J17, J18, J24, J25 are factory reserved. Abnormal operation
may occur if jumpered.

Jumper 22 is sync spindle enabled/disabled  (open=disabled)
Jumper 23 is sync slave/master              (open=slave)
Jumper 16 is I/O Channel Ready              (open=disabled)

Link Options

   In order to install the Rodime Ro 3000A series drives the dumpers for 
the single/dual drive and LED operation on the drive need to be set as 
described in the relevant product specification.
   I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.
   In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a
Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives 
when performing diagnostics.
   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way 
interface connector. They have the following functions and are described 
in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper 
described nearest the 40 way interface connector.

LK2: LED 
     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the
     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An
     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with
     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will
     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130
     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.

LK1: Dual Drives
     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single
     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,
     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.

LK4: Master
     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If
     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be
     jumpered in this way.

LK5: IOChRdy
     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is 
     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher
     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per
     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally 
     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per
     second.

   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)
may be jumpered:

     Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.
     Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.
     Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.
     Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.

   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to
reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.

   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way 
connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected
by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the 
drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further
details.

Please note that these are the *recommended* CMOS parameters. All the disks 
support so-called dynamic translation, and should thus be able to work with
any parameters having fewer sectors than the total number of sectors on
the disk.

Now, according to the manual, the jumper settings are as follows:

Jumper                               CP   MA   SL
-------------------------------------------------
Single                                0    0    0
Master                                0    1    0
Slave                                 0    0    1
Slave with Conner CP342 or CP3022     1    0    1   


Maybe there are 2 kinds of Caviar's floating around: 

If your jumpers read MA SL and SI then use:
Jumper	SI	MA	SL
Single	1	0	0
Master	0	1	0
Slave	0	0	1

There have been reported difficulties in using WD Caviar as Master and
NEC drives as slave - the other way it works.

"""Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be
Impossible""

Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the
headline shown above. The article starts with ""A leader
of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned
space station said yesterday the job is tough and may
be impossible."" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is
possible to cut costs that much and still provide for
meaningful research ""is a real question for me.""
O'Connor said ""everything is fair game,"" including
""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the
aerospace industry, chopping management of the space
station program at some NASA facilities around the
country, working closely with the Russian space station
Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the
manned space shuttle fleet.""

O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options
so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates
into three categories based on cost.

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived
from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe
Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I
listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press
on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor
talked about how the White House wants three options,
sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part
of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has
formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,
modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch
Core [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response to
a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say
the option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate""
cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not
the ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).

The article goes on to describe the other two options
as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle -
the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.""",space station redesign leader say cost goal may impossible today 46 washington post run article headline show article start leader nasa team charge redesign plan space station say yesterday job tough may impossible oconnor quote say whether possible cut cost much still provide meaningful research real question oconnor say everything fair game include drop curtail exist contract aerospace industry chop management space station program nasa facility around country work closely russian space station mir use unmanned titan rocket supplement manned space shuttle fleet oconnor say team review 30 design option far sort serious candidate three category base cost post say oconnor describe design derive current ssf high cost option believe kathy sawyer post writer got confuse listened part oconnor briefing press monday one part briefing oconnor talk white house want three option sort cost low medium high another part briefing discuss three team form look three option ssf derivative larc modular buildup bus1 msfc single launch core wingless orbiter jsc later response reporter question think hear oconnor say option base ssf redesign moderate cost option low high cost option not high cost option sawyer write article go describe two option one feature module could gradually fit together orbit similar russian mir core facility could deposit orbit single launch like skylab option would use exist hardware space shuttle fuselage example basic structure,2,sci.space

RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before
it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.  

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's
orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up,
they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers.
I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit. 

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended
duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support
re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.

THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)
and Orbiter Duration.   

In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,
for a given orbital change.  

From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.

Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the
flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.
The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,
and longer drag life.

Ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter
ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones.
Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics
and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things
continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious
limitation.


I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent
and as bright as the moon.  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the
night sky is on a moonlit night?



Existing satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that
appeared as a point would be useless, so I rather think these will
appear larger than a 'typical' satellite.  Also, satellite tracks *are*
ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey.

What deparment are you in anyway, Philosophy?  You obviously are not
qualified to speak about astronomy...",ahh perhaps astronomer build 2 10meter groundbase scope study design large one seriously though never go get 10meter scope orbit cheaply build one ground adaptive optic good site difference quality narrow quite bit anyway also scope low orbit like hubble observe thing continuously 45 minute time serious limitation sure hell point light half degree extent bright moon ever notice much bright night sky moonlit night exist satellite point light advertising sign appear point would useless rather think appear large notypical satellite also satellite track ruin lot plate current palomar sky survey deparment anyway philosophy obviously not qualified speak astronomy,2,sci.space

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,
you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.
A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or
birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be
the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within
the capability of the amateur rocketry community.

It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction
of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.
Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed
here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year
on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of
an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000
for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure
there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,
or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.

Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.

of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied

One thing to recall.  Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. 
Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in 
its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the 
plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will 
require more fuel to adjust.  This was considered in the original deployment. 

I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous.  
One has to admire how much they are trying to do.

Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull-out, not the dive, that
figure is about right for sustained G, no protection.
The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are
all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented
gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor,
either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled
decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had
to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that
G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting
straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a
good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.

A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a
fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new.

Well, I guess I'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists'
think *they* are.  Yes, I understand the issues.  I don't even
particularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the
sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must
find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.

A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:

	1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it
would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly
low orbit.

	2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?
What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical
astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?

	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of
'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the
sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large
inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?
The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is
being used to help fund this thing.

	4) If your answer to 3) above was ""the astronomers"", then feel
free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more
important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING
ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.


Probably so.  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are. 


Yeah, me too.

...about the protests over proposals to put a giant billboard into orbit,



Mr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  In short,
an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.

Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they are
more like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer

"%
%   Request for opinions:	
%
%   Which is better - a one-piece Aerostitch or a two-piece Aerostitch?
%


Like most everyone else, I ended up getting two different sizes for
the top and bottom.  My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the
bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the
46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have
large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get
them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the
waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece
size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's
problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and
when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).

I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are
in some way different from us real folks.

Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn
wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.
I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a
store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom
in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my
sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally
leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall
down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),
stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),
and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be
running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...

As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably
equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece
provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by
3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around
the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.

So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,
I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I
own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

NETWORK RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of
    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In
    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three
    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent
    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these
    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to
    special 'servers'.

    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of
    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.

    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central
    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In
    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for
    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more
    specialized mailing lists described below.

    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin
    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews
    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a
    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are
    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',
    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called
    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends
    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby
    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so
    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet
    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was
    posted.

    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and
    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not
    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more
    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make
    it the preferred option.

MAILING LISTS

    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the
    International Space University (in only its second change of management
    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body
    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note
    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of
    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are
    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve
	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README
    for further details.

    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle
    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line
    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources
    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.

    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning
    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to
    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.

    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in
    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.

    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;
    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid
    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to
    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and
    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from
    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,
    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.

    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and
    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email
    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your
    name"". Email saying ""INDEX SEDS-L"" to list the archive contents.

    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status
    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in
    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email
    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name"" to join.
    Email saying ""INDEX SEDSNEWS"" to list the archive contents.

    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which
    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him
    to join the list.

    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a
    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate
    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list
    address rather than the request address.

PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION

    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is
    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group

are 3Com 3C505's aka Etherlink Plus cards. Check out ftp.3com.com, there
are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com

program for 3C505 succesfully (""..passes with flying colours"") :)

Anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS/2..?

"About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a
CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I
had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with
CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a
major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver
(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this
until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now
find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled
correctly by the ASW-410 driver.

So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their

This is one of those ""yes, but"" things. It's true that a hydraulically
pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,
but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,
though it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional 
resistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member, 
there's no doubt that hydraulic ""leverage"" exists in nature. Tree roots 
are an example. Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure
increases.


Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the
tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the
tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case
of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather
than locomotion. I don't know much about panda ""thumbs"", so I'll ask
is it opposable?


Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll
bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I
don't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say ""intelligent""
I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level
with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming
suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter 
it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not
a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice
for a putative technological alien.

Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but
it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level
of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron
cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur
wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument
is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room
for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One
reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages 
that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult
for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very
large creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.
Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out
intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.

Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the
lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly
lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature
that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time
to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.
The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production 
because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. 
I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical
reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would
tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that
of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded
creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that
some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature
the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained
or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the
waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the
ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence
to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the
environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur
would be capable of that much activity.

I've done some ASIC and digital design, but not any CPU design.
It would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of
the cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle,
the multiplier isn't multiplying, the barrel shifters aren't shifting,
microcode isn't microcoding, etc.  This means transistors aren't
switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means
less heat.\

From what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the
CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power.

"Serial cables:

There are only three output signals: TD, DTR, and RTS.
There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.

There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.
The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and
CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and
waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an
error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending
AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it
with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very
well have different requirements.

My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but
also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD
and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through
to SG.

I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it

"Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my 
question about which countries engage in space surveillance. 
Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message 
clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, 
rather than space surveillance 

     What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at 
the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have 
programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) 
satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance). 

    The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating 
quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and 
electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. 
The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing. 

    Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches 
and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track 
of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. 
See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as 
the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The 
material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in 
optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be 
that other countries do also.

If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the
one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*
be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,
through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.
Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human
endeavor).


Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?
Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
decrease available traction?  Braking?

It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most
of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency
situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.


I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which
teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the
course.


Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that
point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous.

"Facts:
=====
- A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered
down for three months.
- From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive.
- Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a
- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and 
pronounced the disk drive unusable.

My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).
When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.

I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.

Install will proceed ""successfully"", but when I try to boot the server, it
reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.

Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one
disk drive (or at least one large single unit). 

Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready
errors.

Questions:
=========
The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen
SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II
(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what
is causing my serialisation error?
2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of
which has failed?
3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?
4. What else can cause a serialisation error?
5. What happens if the keycard fails?

and guides.

Thanks for your time.

I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm
dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting
my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system
before. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting. Please
feel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post
this.

"Hello world,
 
I'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an IBM PC for teaching
purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings
of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands, for
example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 AND 1 = 1) so that the
students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally
logical, for example. Every instruction should show some 'working',
and not just alter register/memory/port contents.
 
Does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code,
in Pascal or Modula-2, that would show me where I'm going wrong
in writing my simulator? [I'm using Ayala's -The 8051 Microcontroller-
as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkill
for simple teaching purposes, I feel, and there's no source code to help
you roll your own.]
 
Please email me if you can help, or if you know of somewhere more 
appropriate I should be posting this  - I rarely scan these groups.

"I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend.

I was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding
down Rt. 40 in Groton Ma.  At the side of the road, sitting off on the
shoulder was the killer Volvo in question.  No brake lights, no turn signal,
nothing.  We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front
of me about 2.5-3 sec. back.  Well, as said cage passes the Volvo, the
Brain Dead Idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait
for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic
so that she can turn around...  So I get on the brakes in a effort to not
T-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up.  As she finishes
the turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending
stare.

Where can I get rocket launchers for the VFR?

It would be nice if someone here from the HST program was talking instead
of all the speculation that is going on here. From what I understand from
Dr. Frank Six of the Marshall Space Flight Center there is no insrmountable
problem in bringing HST back. IT was designed that way to begin with.

Also it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items
replaced on this mission. The originals were built by Brit Aerospace and
I think the new ones are too. I am currently working with the guys at MSFC
that are in charge is the HST power system, although I have not spoken with
them in a long time about HST.

fine, only to compress C: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligable

the drive, I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known

The other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed,

American, perhaps, but nothing military about it.  I learned (mostly)
slugs when we talked English units in high school physics and while
the teacher was an ex-Navy fighter jock the book certainly wasn't
produced by the military.

[Poundals were just too flinking small and made the math come out
funny; sort of the same reason proponents of SI give for using that.]

  I am selling my trusty Husky... hopefully to buy a Husaberg...  This is
  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had
  any problems with it.

  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than 
  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better 
  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non
  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.
  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear
  changes.
  
  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike
  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a
  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect
  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced 
  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up

CONSTANTS AND EQUATIONS FOR CALCULATIONS

    This list was originally compiled by Dale Greer. Additions would be
    appreciated.

    Numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most
    blue-skying purposes.

    Unix systems provide the 'units' program, useful in converting
    between different systems (metric/English, etc.)

    NUMBERS

    EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time.
	Additional more specialized equations are available from:

	    ames.arc.nasa.gov:pub/SPACE/FAQ/MoreEquations


	For constant acceleration
	    d = d0 + vt + .5at^2
	    v = v0 + at
	  v^2 = 2ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M / 2 / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc
	    V^2  = u/a
	    P	 = 2 pi/(Sqrt(u/a^3))
	    K	 = 1/2 V**2 - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V = 2 sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/2)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).

	    GMm (1/Re - 1/2Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.

	Classical rocket equation, where
	    dv	= change in velocity
	    Isp = specific impulse of engine
	    Ve	= exhaust velocity
	    x	= reaction mass
	    m1	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
	    g	= 9.80665 m / s^2

	    Ve	= Isp * g
	    dv	= Ve * ln((m1 + x) / m1)
		= Ve * ln((final mass) / (initial mass))

	Relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

	Relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity Ve and mass ratio MR:

	    at/c = Ve/c * ln(MR), or

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(Ve/c * ln(MR))
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(Ve/C * ln(MR)) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(Ve/C * ln(MR))

	Converting from parallax to distance:

	    d (in parsecs) = 1 / p (in arc seconds)
	    d (in astronomical units) = 206265 / p

	Miscellaneous
	    f=ma    -- Force is mass times acceleration
	    w=fd    -- Work (energy) is force times distance

	Atmospheric density varies as exp(-mgz/kT) where z is altitude, m is
	molecular weight in kg of air, g is local acceleration of gravity, T
	is temperature, k is Bolztmann's constant. On Earth up to 100 km,

	    d = d0*exp(-z*1.42e-4)

	where d is density, d0 is density at 0km, is approximately true, so

	    d@12km (40000 ft) = d0*.18
	    d@9 km (30000 ft) = d0*.27
	    d@6 km (20000 ft) = d0*.43
	    d@3 km (10000 ft) = d0*.65

   {Description of ""External Tank"" option for SSF redesign deleted}


Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and
""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign
options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports
that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have
been dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks used
in launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station around
an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""

Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented
to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in
today's Times).

Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular Approach
This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,
there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting
the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and
Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective
teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this
option are:
  -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's
     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C
     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this
     for the Air Force.
  -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.
     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle
     flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment.
     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power
     source for 30 day missions.
  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term
     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the
     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing
     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International
     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The
     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.
     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.
  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and
     add another 20 kW of power
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,
     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return
     Vehicle).

Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom Derived
The Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.
This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we
have all come to know and love :)

This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for
use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the 
number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,
for both options ""A"" and ""B"".

The build-up occurs in six phases:
  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power
     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when
     it visits.
  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist
     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is
     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by
     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes
     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the
     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).
  -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights,
     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal
     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.
  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,
     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the
     assembly in 24 flights.

Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, 
with the exception of the data management system, which has major
changes.",description external tank option ssf redesign delete yo ken let keep ontop thing external tank wingless orbiter option delete ssf redesign option list today 423 edition new york time report oconnor tell panel redesign proposal drop use giant external fuel tank use launch space shuttle building station around exist space shuttle wing tail remove currently three option consider present advisory panel meeting yesterday report today time option low cost modular approach option study team msfc aside ssf redesign team msfc jsc larc support srt station redesign team crystal city lerc reston folk also onsite location help respective team redesign activity key feature option use bus1 modular bus develop lockheed qualify st elv bus provide propulsion gnc communication data management lockheed develop air force power station capability obtain 3 shuttle flight ssf solar array use provide 20 kw power vehicle fly arrow mode optimize microgravity environment shuttlespacelab mission would utilize vehilce power source 30 day mission human tended capability oppose old ssf sexist term mantende capability achieve addition we common module modify version exist ssf lab module dock port add international partner lab take place node ssf shuttle dock station 60 day mission orbiter would provide crew habitability eva capability international human tended add nasda esa module add another 20 kw power permanent human presence capability add 3rd power module we habitation module acrv assure crew return vehicle option b space station freedom derive option b team base larc lead mike griffin option look alot like exist ssf design come know love option assume lightweight external tank available use ssf assembly flight option also number flight compute 516 inclination orbit option b buildup occur six phase initial research capability reach 3 flight power transfer vehicle orbiterspacelab visit mantende capability griffin not yet adopt nonsexist language achieve 8 flight we lab deploy 1 solar power module provide 20 kw power permanent human presence capability occur 10 flight keep one orbiter onorbit use acrv sometimes would two orbiter onorbit acrv second one come logistic resupply two fault tolerance capability achieve 14 flight addition 2nd power module another thermal control system radiator propulsion module 20 flight international onboard power habitation module acrv add finish assembly 24 flight system currently ssf use asis option exception data management system major change,2,sci.space

Well, we already suffer from street hoardings.  If you don't
watch TV, you are free of commercials there, but if you want
to go from A to B you cannot escape beer ads.


I think the right time to stop this proposal is now.

If this idea goes through, it's the thin end of the wedge.  Soon
companies will be doing larger, and more permanant, billboards in the
sky.  I wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky
looks like Las Vegas.  That would _really_ make me sad.

Coca Cola company will want to paint the moon red and white.  (Well,
if not this moon, then a moon of Jupiter).  Microscum will want to
name a galaxy `Microscum Galaxy'.  Where do we draw the line?
Historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines.

I'm normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource
allocation for space research; I think it's the most important
investment possible for mankind in the long run.  But this is not
the way to get the money.

"[much discussion about switching 5.25"" and 3.5"" drives removed]

Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II
(available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT
(also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format
5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5""HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with
many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken
MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25"" disks onto 3.5"" disks or vice
versa...  I use this techniques with ""NON-DOS"" self-booting 
game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program
named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will
also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II
or FDFormat installed....  Some disks that won't DISKCOPY
properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format...
At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS

How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?


If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel
active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device.
So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how
all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.

Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,
but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):",busmastere isa bus talk isa bus 1 dma channel active one time presumably transfer datum single device even though least 7 device scsi bus explain 7 device dma transfer single scsi card isaat bus time also still try track copy ibm reference book pc technical manual page 293,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

1) The next time you get stoped by a cop, never never never admit to anything.

2) Don't volunteer any information.

3) When a retoracle question is ask by the cop, like ""...it <looked> like you were going kinda fast coming down highway 12.  You <must have> been going at least 70 or 75?"" -- the correct reponse is to deny it. This technique is employed by police to help establish guilt, especially when (9 times out of 10) he/she is not sure who was doing the speeding. If the cop is unsure this may be the difference of him letting you off the hook or getting the tissue.

                  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach
                              April 3,1993

     Most of you, as am I, are ""children of the 1960's.""  We grew
up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,
nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were
miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits
have told us - ""you've lost it!""  The ""me"" generation is only
living on the accomplishments of the past.

     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We
listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living
history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell
of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as
General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle
- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.

     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand
dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only
of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.
Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the
best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and
Poseidon ballistic missiles.

     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. 
This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened
to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. 
And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let
me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus
behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest
engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your
insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated
into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.

     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a
single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You
advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are
all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You
convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld
its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a
prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the
generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental
aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little
and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who
started this program for the SDI.

     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even
start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a
little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they
moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more
before putting the first ""rubber on the road.""  Max Hunter - you
didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to
take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable
aerospace transportation is real.

     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same
team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic
Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -
launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about
a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our
commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet
Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored
the importance of our work in bringing about a new international
relationship.

     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the
framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the
next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.

     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This
summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the
first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three
years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space
rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And
yes - we'll make a little money off it too!

     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to
build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of
space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the
rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. 
What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to
counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!

     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to
the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn
V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra
dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital
system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the
way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket

I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), I see this
as something that was designed-in intentionally.

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA)
would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may 
begat an update to the motherboard board design.

What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT 
along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.
If I were you I would be cautious about this.

You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA
motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are
VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'
32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive
than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.

Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-
board.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.  I'm
attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the
AIR board.

Model number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2.  You can call
Motherboard Warehouse (for example) for a price.  Phone #'s included

"*** On 04-19-93  03:53, Wayne Mcdougall had the unmitigated gall to say this:

 WM> The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the
 WM> screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware
 WM> for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

 Yes.  Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two
 disks at once.  Duplexing, which is the preferred way of mirroring, uses
 two controller cards and two disk drives.  Duplexing requires a special
 card and two identical disk drives (in most cases).  Duplexing can
 sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives/controllers, as long
 as the sizes are the same.

 WM> So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

 The configuration is completely up to the user.

 WM> 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this
 WM> what is causing my serialization error?

 If you only have one disk, then you can't use Level II SFT.  However, the
 OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different
 version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error.  Make sure
 that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the
 NetWare installation set.

 WM> 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives,
 WM> one of which has failed?

 Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I, or one volume
 mirrored using SFT II.  Impossible to tell with the network being down.

 WM> 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it
 WM> will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive?

 Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and
 installing the software as one volume under SFT I.  If the software will
 install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work
 in this configuration.

 WM> 4. What else can cause a serialization error?

 See the comment concerning the serial number on the OSOBJ installation
 floppy.

"   We don't disagree on this.  All I said was that a right is whatever
you or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn't
come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly,
the people); from that point it defined legal rights.  ""Common law""
rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a
Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they
demanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate, power is
power.  That's why the federal government can force states to grant
their citizens rights they don't wish to: In a slugging match, the feds
win.  Period.

"Ethnocentric USian that I am, I've assumed that we and the
xUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to track
non-cooperative objects in low Earth orbit. Grazing in a couple of 
databases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilities
along this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposes
for orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can 
determine orbital elements for the objects it detects). Abstracts of 
the articles are appended. 


    This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than 
the US, Russia, and Japan do space surveillance, and if so, how and 
why?

Optical tracking of the experimental geodetic satellite (EGS)
TAKABE, MASAO; ITABE, TOSHIKAZU; ARUGA, TADASHI
Radio Research Laboratory, Review (ISSN 0033-801X), vol. 34,
March 1988, p. 23-34. In Japanese, with abstract in English.
     This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS
(experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13,
1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an
outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <----
station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical
equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit
prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS
tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also
discussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the
position of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was
launched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <----
satellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <----
optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <----
useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <----
stages. Furthermore, the results confirm the effectivenes of these  <----
two satellite optical tracking techniques.                          <----


MU radar measurements of orbital debris

     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross 
section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-
power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data 
processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of 
orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail 
echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, 
they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----
observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----
collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an 
altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as 
once per two years. 


Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C)

      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere 
troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar 
features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large 
VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed 
to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier 
feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast 
beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the 
antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal 
division/combination are performed at a low signal level using 
electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna 
beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the 
zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element 
is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful 
calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna 
element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for 
this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to 
make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern 
monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific 
satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna 
Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 
watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement 
and results are discussed.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a ""turn off"" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can

":    I hate to admit this, and I'm still mentally kicking myself for it.
: I rode the brand new K75RT home last Friday night.  100 miles in rain
: and darkness.  No problems.  Got it home and put it on the center stand.
:    The next day I pushed it off the center stand in preparation for going
: over to a friend's house to pose.  You guessed it.  It got away from me
: and landed on its right side.  
:    Scratched the lower fairing, cracked the right mirror, and cracked the
: upper fairing.  
:    *DAMN* am I stupid!  It's going to cost me ~$200 to get the local
: body shop to fix it.  And that is after I take the fairing off for them.
: Still, that's probably cheaper than the mirror alone if I bought a 
: replacement from BMW.

You got off cheap.  My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain
in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I
finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where
I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling
everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,
signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...

Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,
feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...
Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid
up beside me and asked, ""Friend of yours, Steve?"".  ""Shit, Matty,
it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!""

Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.
Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.
While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty
minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty
presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the
bike.

I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly
afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty
told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went
uncontested.

Space Station Redesign Advisory Members Named

Along with Dr. Charles M. Vest, recently named by Vice President
Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the
Space Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives
from government and industry and academic experts from across the
country to participate in an independent review of the redesign
options being developed by NASA.

""I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this
important review panel. America's future in science and
technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost
attention and care,"" said Vest. ""We have assembled a diverse
panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate
measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical
task.""

The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing
various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA's
redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve
efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space
station international partners also are being asked to 
participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory
committee will submit its recommendations in June.

"The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:
SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer 
base.
SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.
SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, 
and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be
wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses
TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}

From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 
contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1
and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 
controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device
{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs
IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20%
faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device
with a SCSI-2 controller chip.
SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips
{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit
mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips
{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH

I'll say!  Imagine that there were a couple groups up there, maybe landing

Isn't a billion pretty good incentive to take a shot at a potential

On the other hand, if Apollo cost ~25billion, for a few days or weeks

   A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the

best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, 
however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard 
driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available 
on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning 
of the ""normal"" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you 
wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report 
the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

"Hi.

I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.
They are.  There's a space between each link where the ""teeth"" of the 
locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.

Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks ""LOOK"" a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-
cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally 
functional.

Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give
me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights.

I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.
(I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my
body) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).

Well, it's not that simple -- you're in Earth's magnetic field, and you
don't generate electricity -- but it can be done.


The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first
question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than
""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the
Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential
applications for this.

However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't
coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy
of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where
this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion
is useful only in special situations, however.

What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,
and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy
*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.

If you want more information, trying looking up ""electrodynamic propulsion"",
""tether applications"", and ""magsails"".


No.  A ""dragless"" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel
constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*
there was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around ""dragless"".",well not simple earth magnetic field not generate electricity do way power thing electricity answer first question definitely yes mean say propel rather power answer sort yes use interaction earth magnetic field get electrical power potential application however bear mind free lunch energy not come nowhere system convert energy orbital velocity electrical energy case useful tradeoff use power obtain way propulsion useful special situation however get power mean eg solar array run interaction magnetic field reverse pump energy orbit rather take energy want information try look electrodynamic propulsion tether application magsail dragless satellite not magically drag burn fuel constantly fight drag maintain exact orbit would drag quote around dragless,2,sci.space

   Watch out.  Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means
   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I
   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an
   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently
   decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to
   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.
   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.


I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I've
heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto
Guzzis and other relative ""exotics"" since there isn't a large demand
for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.

There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like
particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However,
there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network.
To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large
part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting
but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest
approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the
occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier
mission like Galileo or Cassini.


It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be
worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly
without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community
has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to
arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly
all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can
reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.


Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things
that can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is
*not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.",would point longterm monitor thing like particle field not mention atmospheric phenomenon however particular plan establish sort monitor network precise particular plan period large part problem context not surprising unexcite useful mission like get short shrift budget time close approach sort longterm planetary monitoring mission occasional chance piggyback something like top flashy mission like galileo cassini unlikely much happen pluto would worth monitor prohibitively difficult mission fly without new propulsion technology something planetary community firmly resist guinea pig combine need arrive pluto within reasonable amount time kill nearly cruise velocity settle orbit beyond reasonably do current 1950svintage propulsion do well earth thing not do well voyagerlike spacecraft not constrain need enter orbit around planet,2,sci.space

  Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite
physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  If
your tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is more
likely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a medium
or small helmet.

  This works for me, and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend,
who, at 6'9"", tends to look more for women that are over 6'0"", and can't
usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had...

  Of course, if you aren't picky what size (*cough*) churchgoers you give
helpful motorcycle rides to, then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any
eventuality as far as legality is concerned, and a spare handtowel in the
tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport
(rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.

"ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!

  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, 
ether sucking structures, AND why we observe ""orbital"" motion!!

  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic 
waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the 
Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago. 

  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact 
that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the 
earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption 
that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)

  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the 
development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications 
of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!

  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!

  
1
  I dream like this: ether based reality
 
  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations 
start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices
both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, 
converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. 
(non-spinning lattice = ""dark matter"")

  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image 
of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us 
being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by 
the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is 
spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner 
kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a 
faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground 
of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but 
its ""foot print"" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])
  
  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self 
spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is 
itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the 
wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The ""orbit"" of the
earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around
by the sun's ether feild.

  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and ""distance"" 
apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because 
the ""path"" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like 
sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half 
turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has 
got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to 
the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a ""j"" hook at 
the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the 
whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. 

  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon 
can be about as big as ""earth's"" shadow upon it, and at other times 
totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, 
would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they 
look about the same size?

   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S
 E       /     \            
    M    |      |      OR                M    
         \ _ _ /                         
       S                           
       
  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate
of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating ""turntable view"" 
of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a 
half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the 
day. Try and draw that ""earth shadow."") Its only the moon's image 
which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is 
the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away 
from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.

  ""Light-Years"" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is 
closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase 
of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. 
(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be 
essentially happening now. The ""piece"" of light may have experienced 
many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.

  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to 
de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design 
a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like 
trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)

  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd 
look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just 
might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the 
spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ 
billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG 
backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card 
for Pentium!)

  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound 
media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I 
would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which 
I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. 
[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a 
two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I 
could get with my machine's receiver next to it.  

  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT 
PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of 
life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our 
thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By 
eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant 
instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or 
biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what 
they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we 
don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and 
that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where 
did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it 
is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then 
die)

  Warning about writing to the past:
I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel 
future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. 
There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an 
Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, 
and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the 
others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by 
""advising"" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into 
reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that 
the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to 
provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it 
in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his 
control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying 
that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve 
souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was 
finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in 
our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it 
seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then 
some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no 
more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped 
through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that 
he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, 
existing only on the wind. 

  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls 
whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat 
others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a 
lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for 
playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) 

 Accepting rides to the past:
Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a 
Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go 
ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. 
I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes 
your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross 
paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own 
course of history, none the wiser.

  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped 
back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still 
make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with 
every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which 
loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. 
But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had 
to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand 
to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. 

  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, 
our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: 
Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to 
congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks 
are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big 
corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the 
banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but 
mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 
hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time 
to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If 
we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if 
the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? 

  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, ""its chaos!"" They 
said, ""no, its order."" He defined chaos as that which is he was not 
able to control.

  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy 
would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no 
language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)
(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and 
pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably 
naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should 
be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. 
They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers 
might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a 
different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.

  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a 
huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat 
only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and 
need a lot less sleep.

  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The 
troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill 
each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)

  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot 
tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they 
suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that 
they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. 

  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women 
and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut 
from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think 
that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as 
mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples 
of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.

  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He 
tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which 
the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll 
play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll 
whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to 
live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was 
right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go 
back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over 
your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality 
in which you don't want to be a part of.

thought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight, only the 
innovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding. 
If a PI can show co-funding for any proposal, that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY
higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no 
co-funding. Once again, money talks!

Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with

it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing

the usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so
they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the
adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right
amount of Zipper Squish (TM).


I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the

available for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just
break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then
crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.

You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement
parts.

"We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a
tether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our
succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of
SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented
payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west
coast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered.
We want to build it from ""off the shelf"" technology so as to do this as
quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the
payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the
same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue
Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in
tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs
(Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to
be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:

1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are
there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?

2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they
be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the
relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening
emergencies?

3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant
coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous
orbit?

4.  Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of
these transponders?

I really didn't mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc.  
I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who
say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said,
I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more
specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go 
for the extra cubes.  

I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum
power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note 
and the handling are more important to me.  I just bought a Ninja because I 
couldn't afford a Duc.

Didn't mean to ruffle any feathers, I'll probably be getting a 900SS next

"Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle
dealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself
have never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience
of that visit and of an observation of ""SQUILDLY"" behavior by other 
customers and/or sales personel:

BACKGROUND:

I ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into ""cruiser"" type bikes. My
friend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He
wanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer
that sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. 

The place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few 
Intruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.

Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I 
moseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.
I could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),
but I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured
to each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs
firmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the ""hormone gang""
talking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big
deal.

Here is the part that concerned me. The ""HG"" and those shop personel that were
not busy with customers went back out, where said ""HG"" members fired up their
rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,
one decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.

SQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager
not only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they
were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely
as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her
""pilot"" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers
could be heard as well as felt.

I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those
in cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and
damning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little
uncomfortable and we left. 

I will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my
anger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open
mind and doesn't associate me with them.

The ""artist renderings"" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have
the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree
angle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the
array replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost
will occur with the arrays deployed or not.  However, it doesn't 
appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.

Thanks for the input on GRO's S/A design constraints.  That would 
explain the similar design on UARS.


Heck, the MMS project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind.
The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement
for the instrument module on EUVE.  That way, you get two instruments
for the price of one spacecraft bus (the Explorer Platform).  A 
second on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the FUSE telescope.

[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?
Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

  Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the 
temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said ""Dust grains
acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K.""  Well, I was dead
wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has
informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,
which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field
from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.
Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to
take another ISM class :-(

  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave
a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief
overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of
about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then
gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is 
that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer
solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;
over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got
scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter
and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially
Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -
we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,
already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through
Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].

  He notes that the two recently discovered ""Kuiper Belt"" objects,
1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same 
mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the
larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,
formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material
into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to
ideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence
from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different
(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence
for the impact theory.

  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects
remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's 
orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members
of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies
will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane 
frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons
by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)
is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,
and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms
bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going
to be very hard to see.

  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see
a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.

  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby
mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a
Titan 4 to send the probe on ""just about a rectilinear trajectory""
to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like
to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs
MUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there
will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million
for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally
offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced
to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the
marketplace.

  I'm just telling you what he said.

The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system,

The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the

The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 &

Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future

have the marketing capabilities of Bill Gates my info. is limited. Probably why
the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed (but that
is another flame-ridden story). Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are
binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from
a Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package
ported to a PC), graphical object-oriented design (its all WSIWIG postscript), 
supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around 
the Mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or 
even VMS if you feel the need. No package out there comes even close. I hope 
people will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally

Doesn't sound like they attended, though, does it?  In fact, if we riders
need friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from 
Lynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back
to party some more year after year.


You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these ""lesser
indiscretions"".  If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the
""indiscretions"" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the ""indiscretions""
don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless 
good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that 
really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans 
in the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they 
helped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and the
bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
and good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and party
than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.


If it doesn't hurt anyone, and all the parties to the party benefit
and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless, then who 
needs to ""permit"" or ""justify"" it?  You?  Why do *you* need to do that?


Ironically, these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe.  They've developed a
friendly long-term mutually-beneficial relationship with a group of 
motorcyclists, and aren't as burdened with MC-ignorance as is the general
population because of it.


If such a need exists, it surely must come from within.

As you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know
enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.
There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over
to begin a turn.

	1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.

	2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.

	3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a
	torque which twists the bike over.

Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,
15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be
needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each
effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at
high speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off
bugger all, relatively speaking.

By the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to
run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running
group where we could start ""counter-footing"" arguments and have them
all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?",point experiment would difficult know enough physics situation calculation fact three effect contribute lean bike begin turn 1 gyro effect cause torque twist bike 2 contact patch shift one side cause bike fall 3 contact patch accelerate side cause torque twist bike take average bikerider average bike wheel speed 5 15 50 mph say calculate much twist bar would need produce say 20 degree lean say 2 second effect alone guess slow speed 2 dominant high speed 3 dominant speed 1 contribute not far bugger relatively speak way similar problem runner wants run round corner get lean corner fast running group could start counterfoote argument fall try work go round corner,1,rec.motorcycles

Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never

my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines

Programmatically, yes, we can land an Orbiter with a 5 cm hole in

cause a Crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  There are
a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a Bad Day -- especially

Car accessory shops here sell stuff called T-Cut, which is a very fine
cutting paste for paint, and this will remove the dull finish and
minor acratches. It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that
you probably don't realise is there, and give your paintwork its original
lustre and shine. It can sometimes react badly with metallic paint, though,
so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff. Afterwards
apply wax polish, and all will be well again.

BTW - don't confuse T-cut with the cutting paste used for grinding in 
valves...the principle's the same but the coarseness is vastly different...",car accessory shop sell stuff call tcut fine cutting paste paint remove dull finish minor acratche also remove traffic film stuff probably not realise give paintwork original lustre shine sometimes react badly metallic paint though try carefully go town stuff afterwards apply wax polish well btw not confuse tcut cutting paste use grind valvesthe principle coarseness vastly different,1,rec.motorcycles

order it from the manufacturer directly.  Each one is made to order, at least
if you get a nonstandard length (standard is 5', I believe).

	I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she
doesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It
is made of 3/4"" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,
professionals can open it rather easily:

	1) Freeze a link.

	2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).

	3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are
		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.

	For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is
anywhere from 1/2"" to 7/8"" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type
locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat
in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8"" model).

	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.
Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy
a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some
point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.  
Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work.

Agreed, so I won't respond again.  It's important for all you spacers out 
there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that

   Nick Haines sez;
   >(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in
   >maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case).

   Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never
   heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?

This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to
measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process
by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported
etc.

See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison
Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of
software process maturity are:

1. Initial
2. Repeatable
3. Defined
4. Managed
5. Optimizing

The levels are approximately characterized as follows:

1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical
   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will
   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will
   be.  Most software production is at this level.

2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project
   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects
   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration
   management and quality assurance.

3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is
   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a
   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,
   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the
   project.

4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered
   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this
   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.

5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts
   are effective and certified.",nick haine sez give hear shuttle software rate level 5 maturity strongly doubt lot bug case level 5 many different level never hear rating system anyone care clue rating system use arpa organisation measure maturity software process ie entire process software gets design write test deliver support etc see manage software process watt humphrey addison wesley 1989 excellent software engineering text 5 level software process maturity 1 initial 2 repeatable 3 define 4 manage 5 optimize level approximately characterize follow 1 statistically software process control statistical basis estimate large software long take produce expensive reliable software production level 2 stable process statistical control rigorous project management do something project plan detail software configuration management quality assurance 3 process define understand implementation consistent include thing like software inspection rigorous software testing framework configuration management typically software engineering process group within project 4 statistical information software systematically gather analyse process control basis information software quality measure goal 5 defect prevent process automate software contract effective certify,2,sci.space

Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By 
the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, 
the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round
trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as
5000 kg in a Low Earth ""advertising"" orbit: Very roughly the
same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were
to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...

The night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very 
pristine... 

There's always been a problem of having to get 
away from civilization before you can really find ""natural""
scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip
of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles
or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards
on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still
""wild."" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital
billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of 
growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will
not save your view of the night sky, because by the time 
such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_
the stars...

 
An ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless, since you need
a telescope to see them. However, I'd love to see them get all
the publicity they could from underwritting the ""Coca Cola Io
Orbital Mapping Probe.""

It is heavy, the 91 is mid 600's dry, that is the one major drawback
of the ST.

Did you trythe ABS/TCS version?

above most heads, but hurts the looks of the bike.


This is the essence of the bike, move the throttle and itr accelerates 
any gear anywhere anytime, I frequently find myself at the DOD min 
during a casual passing maneuver.

This is a function of the weight, you have to be aggresive with the brake
squeze, actually as tested by Cycle world and an expert rider the ST
stopped faster then the comparable models from BMW, and YAMAHA even with 
the extra weight and Gas .

You must countersteer the ST for every turn and movement short
of the classic pothole wiggle. Just forget ever leaning into a 
turn again. It must be countersteered into every turn and then 
responds nicely.


Faster then I've ever gone, I 'd hate to buy this bike after your 
short ""break in period""



Not true, the side stand is well designed for the weight and will hold 
the bike nicely on dirt. I am able to easily get the bike up on
the center stand, just step down on the stand instead of pulling
up on the bike.

"I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor
is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  It
isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the
monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.

In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those
are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses
a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite
card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as
I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to
print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3
cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.

The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,
and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.

The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone
with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable
to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have
the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they
were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz
386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers
were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with
8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.


K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second

The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,
filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --
1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what
I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,

Personally, I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from the third degree
burns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the supposed burns
that he suffered in ""the joke"".  Granted I was one of those people that were
taken in by it and I was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for 
pulling such a thing (which I made known to him).

But then again, for an April Fool ""joke"" I would also go on record as saying
that it was the best orchestrated one I've ever seen and it certainly sucked
a LOT of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-\ 8-)...

""sick"" - ""twisted""??? Who in this group could ever be accused of such a thing?

That didn't happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to

The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
no-where to be found....

`My Western Digital also has three sets of pins on the back. I am using it with
`another hard drive as well and the settings for the jumpers were written right 
`on the circuit board of the WD drive......MA SL ??

Well, I figured out how the jumpers go.  Now I have quite a different
problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn't know.  I have both drives
working, the C: system formatted and all of my hardware installed.  Only
problem is, that during the boot up sequence, the computer does not want
to pass up looking for a system on the A: drive.

Reinitialization all goes fine and the BIOS seems to be configured to
what is necessary.  All the drive tests work, but when the thing comes
back around to the a: drive and there is no disk present, it just spins.
If you insert a disk into drive a with a system however, it works fine
and boots up (ie how installed all my software)

Any additional help on this will be most welcome....

I haven't seen any specifics on the HST repair mission, but I can't see why
the mass margins are tight.  What are they carrying up?  Replacement components
(WFPC II, COSTAR, gyros, solar panels, and probably a few others), all sorts of
tools, EVA equipment, and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can.  This
should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission, which achieved the
highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date.  And HST is now in a lower

Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity.

Correct, we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.

Therefore, we can't tell whether they're slightly extra solar
or not!

The question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is
not quite closed, although the odds are against it, and the most that the
more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.

There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.

          ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North 
          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, 
          hardcover. 
          

               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to 
          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. 
          
               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged 
          edition of ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"", 1959.  
          Volume I is ""NOTHING BUT MOTION"" (1979), and Volume II is 
          ""THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"" (1988). 
          
               Most books and journal articles on the subject of 
          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial 
          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by 
          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except 
          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  
          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical 
          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual 
          validity. 
          
               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor 
          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State 
          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books 
          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the 
          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements 
          they contain. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" describes the astrophysical 
          portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of 
          ""grand unified field theory"" that orthodox physicists and 
          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of 
          space and time: 
          
               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. 
          
               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. 
          
               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a 
          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic 
          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the 
          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-
          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was 
          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with 
          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including 
          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 
          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, 
          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They 
          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And 
          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation 
          ready for those also. 
          
               As a result of his theory, which he called ""THE 
          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM"", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the 
          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, 
          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, 
          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), 
          ""nuclear"" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass 
          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in 
          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be 
          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very 
          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, 
          solutions in principle, ""no other way"" declarations, etc., 
          used to maintain them. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" is divided into 31 chapters.  
          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from 
          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, 
          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that 
          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in 
          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy 
          formation from the MYTHICAL ""big bang"" is a big mystery to 
          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life 
          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and 
          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of 
          SINGLE stars. 
          
               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according 
          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have 
          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies 
          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). 
          
               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against 
          observations that contradict their theories would find 
          Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an 
          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY 
          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the 
          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray 
          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from 
          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any 
          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional 
          coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray 
          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER 
          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the ""cosmic 
          sector"".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a 
          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed 
          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE 
          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the 
          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly 
          at random. 
          
               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from 
          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and 
          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted 
          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the 
          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book 
          ""Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey"", by William K. Hartmann, 
          says, ""Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if 
          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars 
          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.""  Larson's book contains 
          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are 
          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, 
          astronomers, and astrophysicists.

machine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages,
especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our
high performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the
Kat.

Luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But
dude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and played
cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can
you get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crap
to convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dude
collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colors
still looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end....
3 inch long engine and other ""minor"" scratches...)

If you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not being
an advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that 
annoying ass noises...), but just think...  The next time you
punched it (whether you have an all mighty ZX-11 or a ""I can
do it"" 250 Ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any   
time.

Peace & ride (kinda) safe.

"Just wanted to ask a question. I bought a hard disk drive second-hand
the other day, and I opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small
sticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it.
It's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my
computer already (it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of
the 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk.
I don't know if disk drives for the Apple (or Mac) are different from ones
used in AT clones, so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk
on my AT clone? If not, what did I just purchase? It's a Quantum Prodrive.
It's dated 1988 on the green board. Will I need a controller/add-in card?
All the help is much appreciated. Thanks! :)

While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding,
I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training 
must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion
to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike 
in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.
Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among 
new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the 
motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the
direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.
I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she
is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the 
motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right 
handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. 
A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn
the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries
to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.

The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency 
situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of
countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.",agree formal training essential safe riding disagree strongly original point point formal training must prepare rider road preparedness opinion know much possible exclude aspect ride bike course wrong imho countersteere particular countersteere something must train common reaction among new biker bicycle rider emergency situation steer motorcycle like bicycle know make motorcycle go direction opposite intend needless say dangerous specific example rider leave turn rider think heshe close right shoulder road try steer motorcycle leave pull leave handle push right handle motorcycle straighten go road bad scenario rider turn middle turn rider see truck come towards himher panic rider try steer motorcycle away truck crash right main function riding course teach avoid emergency situation one thus knowledge training countersteere imho must ride course,1,rec.motorcycles

[Excellent discussion of DC-X landing techniques by Henry deleted]


The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically. 


For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit
noise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines
and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite
that simple.


Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.


The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially
practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings
are also not very comfortable.  However, in the words of Georgy Grechko,
""I prefer to have bruises, not to sink.""

bend their aerial, every time I have done that it has eventually snapped

    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO

    INTRODUCTION

    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet
groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to
leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).

    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to
your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).

    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in
the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.

    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The
point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old
answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization.

    Questions fall into three basic types:

    1) Where do I find some information about space?

    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask
    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There
    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended
    discussion.

    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?

    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been
    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for
    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.

    3) Miscellanous queries.

    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of
    FAQ postings.


    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE

    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.
    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]
    Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.
    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth
	100 posts).
    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST
	not SPACE.
    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all
	references.)
    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're
	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!
    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail
	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the
	'reply' function of mailers will work.
    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone
	will get on TV anyway.
    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:
	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals
	(use carriage returns).

"Organization: Compact Solutions, Canberra ACT Australia

I have a floppy drive which has developed ""General failure"" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5"" drive).

I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.

However, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.

Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it.

Thanks!

Cheers, Ben

come in on schedule and under Cost.  I know the GAO determined

Me, I am allin favor of Government R&D.  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best 
to do research.   I don't think the government should pour money
into any one sector,  but should engage in projects which naturally
push the state of the art.

is a reasonable project at a lower cost.  

Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected.

Maybe what they should do, is throw out much of the process and just tell
new PH'ds,  you get a 1 time grant of $50,000.00   If you produce, you
can  qualify for other grants.  If you don't  you never get in again.

 I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic
to this approach. It's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just 
another worthless adversary. So remember to wear at least calf height leather
boots, ( in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your
attacking foot) and go for the gusto, If that dog doesn't retreat from the
street with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you really
haven't done your bit for all your fellow bikers.

While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the
sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,
it is only ""relatively"" recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,
mis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.
If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother
notifying me of fixes/releases.

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the ""right"" person in curing
some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting
addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the
Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep
explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement.

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some
form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than
Diamond.

			How do I get a DoD number?

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is ""What is the
DoD?"", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be ""How do I
get a DoD number?"" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-
base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not
that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)

Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.

By now you're probably asking ""So who's the KotL already?"". Well, as
John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real ""secret"" left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was
the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the
KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-
oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with ""weenie
mailers""). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
Dead-Head.

***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).

***********************************************************************

One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?
The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &
e-mail address. For example:

0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM

(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)

            ""Denizens of Doom"", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)

      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  
helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve
seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, 
traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double 
entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together.

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.

The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  
the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry 
professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, 
rec.motorcycles (pronounced ""wreck-dot-motorcycles,"" it's the file name for 
the group's primary on-line ""meeting place"") carries about 2250 articles per 
month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred 
to as the DoD.

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, ""Denizen 
of Doom.""  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the 
List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Norway and Finland.

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- 
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 
to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.

As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's 
""Silicon Valley.""  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California 
""Joust.""

The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big 
barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together.  Long may they flame.


""Live to Flame -- Flame to Live""	[centerbar]

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as ""flames"";  
issuing them is called ""flaming.""  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A 
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like:  ""What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad 
poseur!""  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
ability and your cat.

          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_

                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011

Periodically the question ""What is DoD?"" is raised. This is one of
those questions in the same class as ""Why is the sky blue?"", ""If there
is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?"" and ""Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?"", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations. 

A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it ""The Denizen of Doom"". Not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number. 

Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members. 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by
#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and
distributed on VHS by #18)! 

Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. 

The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address. 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name). 

                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live

                      The DoD

              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1
 
Welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The
Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent
(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of
your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against
you. Read 'em and weep. 

We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible
Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to
Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: 

Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! 

Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW
     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer
     11 but what the heck.  

Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.

Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at
     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!
     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a
     Woosh-a-stream.

Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.

Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???

Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see
     what they say, eh? 

Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.

High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.

Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!

Terrible: B.T.???

Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.

Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.

Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? 

Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.

Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.

Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.

Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!

Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???

Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean 
     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! 

Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.

Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with
Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and
the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! 

Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?

Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?

Heritick: Nahhh.

Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.

Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?

Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!

Muck: What's a carbujector?

Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!

Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!

Dill: Well, where do we race?

Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
     ride! 

Muck: No! No! Quiet!

Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!

High: My 9 too!

Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!

Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!

Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more
cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the
infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! 

Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting
     it up on the ole ventral stand!  

Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and
     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! 

Booster: I hate Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.

Booster: I love Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.

Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?

Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.

Muck: What about a Tridump?

Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?

Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?

Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?

Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.

Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.
Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.

Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.

And Now even more west coasters pour in.
Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!

Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!

Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.

Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.

More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.

Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.

With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It
was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. 
Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. 

Muck: Why??

Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.

Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.

Clean: No GOOD!

Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!

Clean: Inferior!

Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys
burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a
thrill... 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? 

Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,
     WILHEM! 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? 

And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all
boomed out.
G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding
     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. 

All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.

Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the
next gut wretching episode of ""The Yearning and Riderless"" with its
ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will
be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the
question of: ""To Helmet or Not to Helmet"" will be aired, this is heady
material and viewer discretion is advised.

          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94


[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call
Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] 

(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens
referring to each other as ""Chuck"". I guess you had to be there. I
wasn't.) 

Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,
 cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
 may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted
 to live a man's life,
[Music slowly builds in background]
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys,
 living the life of a Motorcyclist;
 doing donuts and evading the police;
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
 eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,

	I Want to be      A Denizen!

[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy.] 

Chuck [Sings to the tune of ""The Lumberjack Song""]:

I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:
He's a Denizen and he's okay,
He flames all night and he rides all day.

I ride my bike;
I eat my lunch;
I go to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus]:
He rides his bike;
He eats his lunch;
He goes to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus refrain]:
'Cause He's a Denizen...

I ride real fast,
My name is Chuck,
It somehow seems to fit.
I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,
But like a real good sh*t.

Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Chorus refrain]:
Oh, He's a Denizen...

I wear high heels
And bright pink shorts,
 full leathers and a bra.
I wish I rode a Harley,
 just like my dear mama.

[Chorus refrain]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    Why you have to be killed.

Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started
as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.

Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: ""What does DoD
stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?"" Naturally, a
Denizen who had watched the movie ""Top Gun"" a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied:

""That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.""

And the rest is history.

A variation on the ""security"" theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where
known) include:

Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     The rec.moto.photo archive

First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.

Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the
server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,
the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive.

**********************************************************

Via ftp:

cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]

Via e-mail:

The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the
message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For
rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:

dir [dod]
send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif
send [dod]dodframe.ps

and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.

Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of
50K each; not a good idea.

Cerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner

**********************************************************

A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (California time). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Patches? What patches?

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &
pins. And your reaction was probably: ""I want!"", or ""That's sick!"", or
perhaps ""That's sick! I want!""

Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't
because of any ""exclusivity"" attempt, but simply because there is no
""DoD store"" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is
someone says ""I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost
$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?"" Then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a
DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and
perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),
motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts
(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and
patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand].

All ""profits"" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of ""Denizens
of Doom, USENET, The World"", complete with a DoD pin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.

~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles
~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>
~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum
~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT

I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,
the other day.

""Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:

Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently
being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,
I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank 
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

                                Sincerely,


                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395
                                Director

P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board.""

As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this
amount possible.

Arnie

rules of the DoD. In order to fan the flames, here is the complete text
of the rules governing the DoD.

			Rule #1. There are no rules.
			Rule #0. Go ride.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Other rec.motorcycles information resources.

There are several general rec.motorcycles resources that may or may not
have anything to do with the DoD. Most are posted on a regular basis,
but they can also be obtained from the cerritos ftp/e-mail server (see
the info on the photo archive above).

A general rec.motorcycles FAQ is maintained by Dave Williams.
Cerritos filenames are FAQn.TXT, where n is currently 1-5.

The DoD Yellow Pages, a listing of motorcycle industry vendor phone
numbers & addresses, is maintained by bob pakser.
Cerritos filename is YELLOW_PAGES_Vnn, where n is the rev. number.

The List of the DoD membership is maintained by The Keeper of the List.
Cerritos filename is DOD.LIST.

This WitDoD FAQ (surprise, surprise!) is maintained by yours truly.
Cerritos filename is DOD_FAQ.TXT.

Additions, corrections, etc. for any of the above should be aimed at

            Updated stats & rec.motorcycles rides info

Some of the info cited above in various places tends to be a moving
target. Rather than trying to catch every occurence, I'm just sticking
the latest info down here.

Estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35K  [news.groups]
 
Approximate DoD Membership: 975  [KotL]

DoD contributions to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle
Heritage Museum. Over $5500  [Arnie]
 
                        Organized (?) Rides:

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third
year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north
as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]

Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,
riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal
2-strokes.  And though it's not an ""official"" (as if anything could be
official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.
European Denizens have staged some gathers too.  (Your ad here,
reasonable rates!)

BusLogic just announced the BT445 FAST SCSI-2 VLB Interface as of
April 20.  This always happens to me!

I have a one week old BT545S which is the ISA version.  I am
enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC2105 560mb 10ms
3.5"" HH 5200 RPM drive.  I'll be changing to the BT445 VERY soon,
though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with
the 32bit VESA support.

You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question. I hear that
the support is excellent.   I have not had to call them myself yet.

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,
and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM
port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just
searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The
first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by
the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set
of ""standard"" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the
order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for
serial ports.

So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were
this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS
to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the
field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that
there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle
program that would actually have a problem with this.)

"Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,
I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been
trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since
my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]
He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number
but I can find out.)

Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get
one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both
at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -
never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS
correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the
master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't
know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers
properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).

The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've
tried several combinations:

controller - master - slave
controller - slave - master
master - controller - slave

None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.

Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for ""C: drive"" and ""D:
drive"" setup info rather than ""drive 1"" and ""drive 2"" like most others
I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?

So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some
info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so
it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!

Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have
two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help!

transfer data at 28800baud without any hardware alternation. Is this

I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that
when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan
monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections.  For this reason, I use the
""factory defaults"" for position/size on the ATI card
and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)
at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan
monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is ""detected"".

": >What tube does the Viewsonic 17 use?  Does is support 1600x1280?  I've been

: >controls, supports up to 1280x1024NI, and has .25mm dot pitch - It can be
: >found for under $1000.

: The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on
: a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
: 76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
: and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't
: handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.

I don't know which tube the Viewsonic 17 uses, but it has an 82khz horizontal
bandwidth so you can go pretty high.  I ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as
fast as the Orchid P9000 could drive it.  Also, the 17 does claim to be able
to support 1600x1280, but I have no experience with that.

Since I have the spec sheet in front of me I'll type some in:

CRT:	17"", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflection, RGB mediou short
	persisance, Tint (TM=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflection

Input Signal:  RGB Analog 0.7Vp-p, 75 ohms (also has setting for 1Vp-p)
	Sync: H/V Separate(ttl), composite (+/-), sync on green (+/-)
	horizontal freq: 30-82Khz, vertical freq: 50-90Hz
compatibility: PC from VGA to 1600x1280 non-interlaced, mac IIci and above
controls: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color
	temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off.
video band witdth: 135 MHz
Max brightness: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field
misconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner
dimensions: 16.3""x16.22""x17.64"", weight 42.6 lbs

I don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just 
typed them in.  Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple
dynamic astigmatism focus'.  Right.  They mean they use two lenses.  Advanced
Invar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have
been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,
and blue.  How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me.

But beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at.  Sharp, clear,

question:  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been

Subject: Diamond Stealth: HELP!
Date: Wed Apr 21 16:54:39 1993

Hello,

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version
with the DIP switches on the back).  I have two problems:

1 ) I've lost the manual!!!

2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and
    everything works fine until I run windows, when
    the network connection dies.

    (In case it's important, the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O
     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is
     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)

    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't
know the Bboard number.

    If you can, please help me with as many of the following
as possible:

a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number
b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card
    (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668)
c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get
    everything working.

    Any help at all would be much appreciated.

"I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for
mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of
complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One
article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4"").

Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has
a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it
is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't
fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right
side doesn't help matters.

What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want
to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? 
Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?
You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they
exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?

Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone
know how they perform?


As implimented on what system?  


Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive
controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?


The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card
(or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to
come down in price.",not start specsheet isa bus first quote scsi spec till blue face exceed isa bus capability point say ide limited 5 megssec vlbide anyone know perform implimente system give original question scsi use single hard drive controller necessary get scsi drive least 5 maybe 10 megssec scsi choice make sence 200400 meg 5 megssec scsi drive cost original cga cart back 84 300 think original ega card pga 800 scsi stand relatively alone not come price mainly talk pc not sun sparc sgi name favorite unix workstation million pc buying decision year scsi plenty time come price,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

First I've heard of it. Offhand:

Griffin is no longer an ""office"" head, so that's bad.

On the other hand:

Regress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by Griffin, because
that would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a
mission to Mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be
no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...

They were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants
somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
the same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's
a communist hardliner.

At least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward
won't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
ghetto. That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
good. And if he brings something up, noone can say ""why don't you go

expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.

A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb
flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do
they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy
drive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk
and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.

On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a
PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing
optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a
product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format
is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is
identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was
quoted as saying that a 2.5"" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data
though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being
productized.

The article said that one of the problems holding back development in
this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2
distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it
probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it
into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it
probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead
to get MDs accepted.

"Hi all,
Of late my computer's Power supply fan has begun to make a lot of noise. What
can I do about this? If I had to get new power supply, or get a new case,
where is a good place selling good tower cases and PS. I know there are a 
couple dozen listed in the Computer Shopper, but I was looking for personal

"I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs
RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to 
install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could
select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever
installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested
the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a
parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as
also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels
are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe
recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). 

Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a
special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the 
problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it

Reboost may not be a problem, if they have enough fuel.  If they don't do a 
reboost this time, they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing
mission.  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
back and you could have problems.  The shuttle just isn't designed to land 
with that much weight in the payload.


of course that is a concern too, and the loss of science during the time
that it is on the ground.  plus a fear that if it comes down, some
big-wig might not allow it to go back up.  but the main concern, I
believe is the danger of the landing.  Just to add another bad vibe,
they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument.  Finally, 
this is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and
service a space station.  Hubble was designed for in flight servicing.

bringing the telescope down, to my understanding, was considered
even very recently, but all these factors contribute to the 
decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning.

"Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my
Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few
changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5.
(The card is revision 5A)

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part
of the ISA bus.

The question I have is simple:
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does?

To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the
BALE line?

On a related note:
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name
chart, but that is it.

"Archive-name: space/acronyms
Edition: 8

Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle:
Edition 8, 1992 Dec 7
Last posted: 1992 Aug 27

This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your
favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not*
on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure
it out, I'll add it to the list.

Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*
acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated
every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)

The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All
comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.

Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your
own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.
Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of
the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply
different ways of referring to the same thing.

Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of
the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),
who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in
character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),
who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and
terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).

Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA
Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and
Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly
mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.

Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program
written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the
acronym list in an entertaining fashion.  Thanks, Larry!

"Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'
                                             op 26 april 1993


In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de
Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar
eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede
universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste
waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde
in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de
voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350
jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.

De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten
sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,
vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala
aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een
planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal
voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies
Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er
staat echter meer op stapel.

Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een
sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het
symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het
huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten
'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.
Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de
deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van
de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de
eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een
beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,
waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een
half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten
zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot
het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op
een apart vel.
Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars
studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN
ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!

Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed
gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht
Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen
het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van
een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,
in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.
Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel
opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en
trachten te verklaren.
Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de
technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn
namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10
miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30
Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal
er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse
technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.

Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en
f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het
verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening
44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de
ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te
worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving
wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na
31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.

Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I,
Universiteit Utrecht.

Voor meer informatie over het symposium kan men terecht bij
Henrik Spoon, p/a S.R.O.N., Sorbonnelaan 2, 3584 CA Utrecht.

   Unless I'm imaging things, (always a possibility =) 1992 QB1, the Kuiper Belt
   object discovered last year, is known as Smiley.

As it happens the _second_ one is Karla. The first one was
Smiley. All subject to the vagaries of the IAU of course,
but I think they might let this one slide...

Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be
some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use
the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.

Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of ""free interrupts.""  I had a
tape controller (not a ""floppy tape"") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an
*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my
modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and
the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt
handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate
an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape
controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would
most likely ""hang."")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it
installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for
the serial port.

Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.
That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.
Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)

"Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):

There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its
rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's some
information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay
Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to
learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have
some money available...

Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,
and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'
orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from
Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about
the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy
and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell
of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my
attention.

THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?


  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July
  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,
  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,
  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3
  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with
  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something
  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.

  Jay

and again:

  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet
  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would
  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and
  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a
  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't
  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are
  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One
  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.

I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

Some background about my PC:

	dos=high,umb
	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems

- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.

The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31

I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.
Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows.

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. The
following are some of them:

- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some
  number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)
- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address

Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address
0001:XXXX means? 

I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.

Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface
into sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without
sunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial
tilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets over
a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.

At the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their
equinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each).
If we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole
(on each) will be in long-term shadow.  This will get steadily worse the

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon

Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it.  It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here

INTRODUCTION

     From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for
untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of
light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these
objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman
deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;
Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and
beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The
stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors
or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.

     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.
Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were
discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were
calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device
called the telescope at the heavens and made startling
discoveries.

     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of
solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World
War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity
and travel to the Moon and to other planets.

     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then
human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated
machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the
Sun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys
while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and
understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight
and other ""senses"" of our automated spacecraft, color and
complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared
to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.
And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.

     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights
through the solar system as some of the most remarkable
achievements of the 20th century.
     

AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT

     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)
automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many
shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and
specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.

     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments
selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems
for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well
as for processing data and communicating with Earth.

     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft
instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays
of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its
solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for
backup and supplemental power.

     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed
millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a
planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments
pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help
prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to
control spacecraft.

     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a
constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers
used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to
maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto
fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a
spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body
and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The
thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed
of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at
the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.

     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to
study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the
inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These
three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets
because they share a solid-rock composition.

     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA
employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the
Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later
missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted
the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.

     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power
source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had
two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were
equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal
bodies.

     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus
spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the
Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147
pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the
program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had
originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The
Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components
left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.

     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.
Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite
different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.

     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers
-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar
system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took
anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.
Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first
human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's
light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers
do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity
generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.

     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit
our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin
Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather
stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --
descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers
from Earth and then studied martian features from above.

     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.
The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument
that allowed it to ""see"" through the planet's dense cloud cover
to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried
four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and
the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --
radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their
descent toward the surface.

     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including
Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet
Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being
developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed
examinations that will increase our understanding of our
neighborhood and our own planet.
     

The Sun

     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start
with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing
approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;
all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up
to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the
material left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine
Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its
interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.

     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of
fusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees
Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there
is 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's
surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.
At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing
energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams
of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.

     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years
and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or
so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium
into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing
so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a
""red giant,"" it will suddenly collapse into a ""white dwarf"" --
the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion
years to cool off completely.

     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but
none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately
two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,
the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft
have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,
launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and
the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to
change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar
regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of
studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.

     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If
it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly
never have developed on Earth.
     

Mercury

     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the
primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on
November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a
journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,
the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the
solar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.

     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the
best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct
object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the
Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is
visible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it
is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar
telescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to
the voyage of Mariner 10.

     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an
ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own
Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the
planet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior
cooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as
high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310
miles).

     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the
density of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon
and helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,
surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees
Fahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius
(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface
temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --
is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury
literally bakes and freezes at the same time.

     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a
slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid
revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury
solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time
it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the
Sun! 

     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like
that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich
core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would
make Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core
or those of any of the planets.

     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two
additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --
before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted
and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same
local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was
illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the
planet's surface.
     

Venus

     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary
neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2
spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more
than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the
mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,
plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,
romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to
rest.

     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839
kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first
spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured
Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much
closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544
miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's
instruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,
radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner
10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth
showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.

     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were
launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4
of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first
spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.

     Five days later, the five separate components making up the
second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the
Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The
four small, independent probes and the main body radioed
atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the
surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the
probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to
transmit data for another hour.

     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and
density more closely than any other known planet. However,
spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For
example, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)
compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other
planets.

     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as
dense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of
Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a
greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but
trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into
space. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is
482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt
lead.

     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the
first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and
determining surface features over almost the entire planet.
NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in
orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses
radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images
of the surface.

     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic
features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface
show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows
lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar
Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At
one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size
of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a
100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep
impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are
named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are
the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million
years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.

     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the
result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics
on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to
weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing
the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like
the San Andreas Fault in California.

     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,
high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At
speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,
the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The
circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'
slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in
both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six
alternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified
laboratory for the study of our weather.
     

Earth

     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing
characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses
and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting
of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other
constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor
life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million
kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the
Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter
just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.

     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give
rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the
atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation
coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects
us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can
strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no
evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon
after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the
other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in
the early days of the solar system.

     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our
home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was
launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and
discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen
radiation belts, surrounding Earth.

     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our
planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by
the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously
ejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does
not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now
know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and
uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and
contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the
upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.

     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise
to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged
particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic
field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's
magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are
known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.

     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in
space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These
watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous
global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and
contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather
systems.

     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey
Earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's
health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided
tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our
planet in dangerous ways.
     

The Moon

     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first
human footsteps on an alien world were made by American
astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless
companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo
expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and
Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.

     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials
and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the
lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection
of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)
and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.

     From this material and other studies, scientists have
constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.
Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3
billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's
existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.
As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into
different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids
and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode
Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created
basins hundreds of kilometers across.

     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four
billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,
overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken
rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to
melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million
years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose
from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the
surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas
that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,
called maria, meaning seas.

     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant
volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.
Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by
micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,
by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and
astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion
years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the
one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the
Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.

     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories
attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate
body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was
captured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a
collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.
The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.
     

Mars

     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.
Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what
appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These
observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led
to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a
system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson
Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction
classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed
in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.

     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to
do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's
surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might
support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months
and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.

     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.
Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one
placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively
before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.

     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,
1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the
surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the
planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring
channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.
Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of
1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a
diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry
atmosphere of carbon dioxide.

     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a
mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The
spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to
find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made
surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the
storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329
pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,
including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across
the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.

     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft
-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from
Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several
questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?
Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was
hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at
least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.

     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully
touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,
while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos
sent back from the Chryse Planitia (""Plains of Gold"") showed a
bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the
lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked
by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives
the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia
Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape
than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible
dunes.

     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking
Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil
were tested in three different experiments designed to detect
biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to
indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this
activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil
chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the
Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist
there.

     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind
velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and
pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest
temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7
degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.

     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees
Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2
site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at
the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but
because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking
Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably
water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.

     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily
carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small
percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much
water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,
forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around
the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning
fog can form in valleys.

     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian
atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical
features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and
islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.

     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and
irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is
possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too
close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.

     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins
their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The
first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on
July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.
Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut
down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on
August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was
used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.

     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology
experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except
Earth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in
September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian
environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. 
     

Asteroids

     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic
objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be
considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as
asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a
band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have
orbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth
has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,
best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near
Winslow, Arizona.

     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the
solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a
planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More
likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a
planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was
gathered into a single object, the object would be only about
1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the
diameter of our Moon. 

     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It
is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be
photographed through Earth-based telescopes.

     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from
examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of
Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are
called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at
high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to
incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the
meteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes
Earth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places
to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.

     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of
silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and
nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony
meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much
like terrestrial rocks.

     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar
system, scientists are interested in their composition.
Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found
that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are
separated by very large distances.

     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids
for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in
October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to
Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini
missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for
launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini
missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as
well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.
One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw
materials.
     

Jupiter

     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of
our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four
spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these
colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter
was the first port of call.

     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in
March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid
belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In
December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,
flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's
banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1
and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned
spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites
during flybys in 1979.

     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of
liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere
composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice
crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps
phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that
characterize Jupiter's atmosphere.

     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases
react to form organic molecules in the regions between the
planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying
below. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these
organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.

     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through
telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's
atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a
high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction
opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is
surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and
are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a
million years old.

     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's
northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned
the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.

     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a
dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The
massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a
miniature solar system.

     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under
way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once
past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two
asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into
Jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo
Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close
to Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two
Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.
     

Galilean Satellites

     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and
spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first
time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of
their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the
Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily
traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs
returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these
planet-sized satellites.

     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission
was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.
Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world
other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine
active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending
as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.

     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow
hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to
the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this
satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the
gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three
Galilean moons.

     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the
brightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a
complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been
fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa
has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --
apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered
by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the
cold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its
center.

     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and
Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest
satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury
and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or
ice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different
brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of
the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the
surface.

     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the
lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large
amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the
most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity
during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.

     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be
performed by the Galileo Orbiter.
     

Saturn

     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its
exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is
composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors
and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere
has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted
by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking
appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity
equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100
miles) per hour.

     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11
sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,
returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in
November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that
revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring
system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in
August 1981.

     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles
orbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive
distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves
passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely
in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are
bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.

     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body
ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been
torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its
interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin
with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A
third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions
with larger objects orbiting the planet.

     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each
other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by
the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These
complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets
that make up the major rings.

     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM
car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager
spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are
believed to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its
atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at
Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near
Saturn's poles.

     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several
satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons
shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps
in the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from
images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. 

     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based
atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in
composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and
Venus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290
degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands
rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.
Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's
dense clouds.

     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be
converting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in
combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter
compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may
be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth
between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's
atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit
progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.

     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini
mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will
also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into
Titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the
probe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will
spend years examining the Saturnian system.
     

Uranus

     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting
Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the
Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about
Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from
ground observations since the planet's discovery over two
centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.

     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the
solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of
Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and
south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing
around the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole
faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an
Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the
solar system.

     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow
the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,
the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's
center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one
magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of
Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.

     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12
percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water
vapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its
atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580
kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud
tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).

     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of
photochemical ""smog"" believed to be a combination of acetylene,
ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the
planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into
space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as ""electroglow.""

     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'
cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and
dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.
Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.

     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105
miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --
Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from
520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing
a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock
spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past
activity, including faulting and ice flows.

     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface
features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and
winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,
after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with
another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which
contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments
from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda
apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in
its interior exposed on its surface.

     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged
11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright
particles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,
boulder-sized chunks.
     

Neptune

     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system
with an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On
August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers
(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.
During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's
atmosphere was more active than Uranus'. 

     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the
size of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's
Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves
westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager
2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed
the ""Scooter,"" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main
hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any
planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per
hour.

     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen
and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core
contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the
other gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like
Uranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.

     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's
spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is
similar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of
the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,
where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the
electrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the
other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only
slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.

     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.
Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of
material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how
Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from
spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected
these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.
A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies
were not spotted.

     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in
1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new
moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since
Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's
glare for observers on Earth.

      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six
days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly
towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in
astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian
gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to
accompany the planet's modest current rings.

     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of
Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at
Saturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of
water-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and
methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of
terrain: the so-called ""cantaloupe"" terrain and a receding ice
cap. 

     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the
fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas
and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers
(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as
thick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and
deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet
found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees
Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other
object spacecraft have so far visited.
     

Pluto

     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the
eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside
Neptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will
remain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --
tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.

     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a
celestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be
approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the
size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's
surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin
atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet
moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin
axis is tipped by 122 degrees. 

     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in
1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the
moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane
ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both
bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's
and Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution
are all 6.4 Earth days. 

     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is
currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.
     

Comets

     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a
visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and
metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets
are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only
far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a
loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching
perhaps halfway to the nearest star.

     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are
gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close
to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer
planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually
warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner
planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself
is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally
of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar
to those composing the moons of the giant planets.

     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma
or cloud-like ""head"" that can measure tens of thousands of
kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the
Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes
on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving
rise to the comet's ""tails."" Gases and ions are blown directly
back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.
As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are
left behind in a curved arc.

     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in
effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.
The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in
length, but the total amount of material contained in this
dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --
from the Latin cometa, meaning ""long-haired"" -- are essentially
dramatic light shows.

     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but
others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close
encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter
visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return
to the inner solar system.

     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively
short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76
years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.
Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular
visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,
because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,
based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name
became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet
returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to
see it.

     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes
comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent
appearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million
kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was
visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern
hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so
bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.
Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens
and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.

     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will
become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and
remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF
will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing
sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and
form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at
high speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer
in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet
and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by
Halley's Comet in 1986.
     

Conclusion

     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of
space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had
only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,
spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our
neighbors in space. 

     We have learned more about our solar system and its members
than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated
spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets
beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large
as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar
environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of
bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for
generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange
and beautiful places and objects.

     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar
system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and
meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called
comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,
moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and
similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history
of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.

     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather
systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by
investigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the
solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and
processes on Earth.

     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated
spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission
is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach
the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future
missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid
belt.

     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once
again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not
been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being
formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the
human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian
outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a
lunar base or a martian colony!",file text image file jpl mission available jpl info public access computer site reachable internet via anonymous ftp pubinfojplnasagov 12814962 dialup modem 1 818

Paris, 19 April 1993

UN/ESA joint training course on satellite applications
to be held in Italy, 19-30 April

The United Nations and the European Space Agency (ESA)
are jointly organising a training course on the applications of
satellite data gathered by the European Remote Sensing
Satellite (ERS-1), to be held in Frascati, Italy, from 19 to 30
April. The training course will discuss the applications of
satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy
and the environment.

The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone
African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space
Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for
coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing
satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,
selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western
and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will
attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote
sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1
data.

The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991
with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar
instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing
missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year
2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the
potential of experts using the practical applications of radar
remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy
and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications
to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-
coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.

The education and practical training programme was
developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The
facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and
information documents for the training course, will be
provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will
include high-level experts from other European and African
organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for
the training course are being provided by the United Nations

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2
IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and 
1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have
a Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC 
before.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.
However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to
be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other 
controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).
just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.
Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to 
ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you 
have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so
on.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.

"Hmm.  $1 billion, lesse... I can probably launch 100 tons to LEO at

fuel, a bigger Mercury or something (might get that as low as two
tons), leaving fifteen tons for a one-man habitat and a year's supplies?
Gee, with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off

                      PRESS RELEASE
 TO::  ALL BMW RIDERS
 SUBJECT:: RALLY TIME IS HERE
 FROM:: BMW CLUB OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
 
 BMW 49'ER RALLY, MAY 27-31  (U.S. Memorial Day Weekend)
 San Francisco Bay Area - 20th annual BMW 49'er Rally, sponsored by
 The BMW Club of Northern Califronia,  will be held at the Quincy, 
 California Fairgrounds, from May 27-31, 1993
 
 	Included in the $42 pre-registration fee, $47 at gate, are 4 Star
 camping, field events and trophies, two dinners, rally pin, door prizes, 
 Poker Run, vendor displays, Fun Run, English Trials, and live music playing
 throughout the weekend.  Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse
 D'Elegance and more.
 
 	This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the 
 event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,
 ""The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more
 complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our
 two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River
 Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's
 Highway 49.""
 
 	Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a 
 pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.
 	
 	The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,
 two miles South of downtown Quincy.
 
 	For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug
 Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA
 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195

 ADDITIONAL NOTES:: 
   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.
   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one
   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so
   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.

   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.
   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa, 
   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.
   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.
   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. 
   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early
   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays
   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday
   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the
   awards ceremony.

ram, a *local bus* IDE *and* SVGA card,  a *250* mb hd, and a *15""*

"I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system:

486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram
on a Novell 3.11 network
Monitor:  NEC 4FGe, capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate

Major considerations:

I expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS
applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word
processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics.

With a 15"" monitor, I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256
colors seems plenty, but I'd like like the image to be sharp, fast,
and rock solid.

Other considerations:

I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some
companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party
development of drivers.

I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability
than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking.

I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest
in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later).

I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.

If you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it via email or post.

Thanks.

"I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3, but
when I insert that card into my DOS 5.02 PC, it shows up
as COM3, with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)!

When I get into debug, and dump the data at 40:0, it shows
the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3 - even though the modem
should be at COM4.

Now, I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested
it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4, 2E8, IRQ3.

To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC, I have to configure the
modem as COM3, 2E8, IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that
allows that, the FAX program that came with the modem does not work.
Anyway, I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set,
as COM4...
I did run a few diagnostic programs, and they did not help at all:
a few displayed the modem as COM4, and others displayed it as
being COM3.

I am not using Windows, this is just a DOS problem...Any help
or pointers appreciated....
For various reasons, I must have this modem work at COM4, thus
switching COM ports is not an answer...

this time I have included all the specific information....please help!)

"Several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the
Great 72"" reflector built at Birr Castle, Ireland in 1845 which remained the
largest in the world until the the start of the 20th century.

""The Astronomy of Birr Castle"" was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on
the committee which is going to restore the telescope. (The remains are on
public display all year round - the massive support walls, the 60 foot long
tube, and other bits and pieces). This book is the definitivie history of
how one man, the Third Earl of Rosse, pulled off the most impressive
technical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and
the discoveries made with the instrument.

Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore
the telescope. Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by
mail order. It's a fascinating read and by ordering a copy you bring the day
when we can all look through it once again that little bit nearer.

Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the
following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified
explanation.

Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer
adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that
""Something's happening here, please take note."" How the CPU is
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.
In MS-DOS, the ""interrupt vector"" is used to store the address of the
function that handles each interrupt.

Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready
to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When
DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,
wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to
the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's
free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. 

With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing
approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU
cycles.) Hence, you can't ""share"" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're
running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.

Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses
interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what
to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is
required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is
needed.

You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use
them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine
is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came
from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.

Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the
general picture correctly enough.

Cheers,

Netters!

I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask
the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper
ones that I want to know more.
The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening
to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's, but
that's not really relevant at the moment.

I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated.
They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2.
The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give
your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not
all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as
a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq.

I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually
about times 1.8.

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ).
The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can
operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.

A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate
even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape
units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do
something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be
what I am doing while reading this group.

Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,
thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is
better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to
completely get rid of IDE.

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post
you stated that the ""wrap"" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.
Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.


Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum
attack and you know it.


Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true. Which is it Allen?


As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.
Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.


Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There
is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo?


Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what
they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. 


I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called
leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership
and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of
leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this.


No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have 
happened in the first place.

I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to

But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x
three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form
an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different
beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of 
the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the 
differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.
Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have
any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to
determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small 
component to the positional error.  

Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort 
cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together 
now: ""Parallax ARc SECond"", a parsec is the distance of an object 
that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).
If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to 
have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.

The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and
watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination

Uh, why do they have to ask a state commision? Unless the state's buying...

Such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company
of selling different types of light, and will decreace the likleihood
that they will do so. And any efficient lights they might have been
planning in the future, go down the drain.....


You could order it special. If enough people did so, it would be 
low cost. Last I checked, you could use UPS to buy stuff in Arizona
before going there.

Finally, I'm sure your state has things like small factories and
machine shops. You could go into business making lights that are
cheaper to use (thanks to their higher efficiency and the
fact that they aren't wasting energy on broadcasting to space)
and therefore _better_ than the old style...


Five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy
will fall apart.
  

As if the clean air act really cleaned up the air...


_MY_ *experience* seems to suggest that you're trying too hard
to *educate* them (with the same methods used in American schools
to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as Proto-Ugric)
instead of *selling* them on the idea.

...

Well, wake up. Space is becoming a field of human endeavor
instead of just something we can look at from a long long
way away. There are practical space projects that could conceivably
(although probably not) cause lots of light pollution, and 
have been argued against on those grounds, even though they
might open up such possibilities, that people could vacation on
Mars if they wanted really dark skies...

   Request for opinions:	

   Which is better - a one-piece Aerostitch or a two-piece Aerostitch?


   We're looking for more than ""Well, the 2-pc is more versatile, but the 
   1-pc is better protection,...""	

   Thanks in advance,
   Nadine


What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.
If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero
dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)
you can just detach and stow the pants. 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and
petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I
got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not
really that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must
be).

He's right ya know.  I've helped to install Dos 6 on about 4 computers now,
mine included.  On one, he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter,
and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).

In other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.
Seems to work for me.


Well, I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's
worth.


Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still
faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression,
I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin
load before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys
or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.

Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff.  Plus, the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay, but I
much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus,
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.

"Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems:

1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB
   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K
   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB
   VRAM.

2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:

   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be.

   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you
      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).

3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development
   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed
   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.

   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   ""R"". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it
   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.

   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode.
   
   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one.

I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

Some motherboards support VL bus and 50-DX CPU.  There is an option
(BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to
CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives
the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s)
are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to
enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.

This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre-
tations.  Your mileage may vary.

Strictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at
least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.

connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232

"Picture our universe floating like a log
in a river.  As the log floats down the
river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the
bank, the bottom, other logs.  When this collission
occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the
log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy 
translaions occur.  The distribution of damage to
the log depends on the shape of the log.

However, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a
termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the
collissions would appear uniformly random in direction.

This is my theory for GRB.  They are evidence of our universe
interacting with other universes!  Why not!  Makes
just as much sense as the GRB coming from the Oort cloud!

The log theory of universes can't be ruled out!

Of course, I'm a layman in the physics world.  You 
physicists out there, Tell me about this !!!!

Tom's right about this.  It's only a grantable right if the granter has
the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you.
Never mind the legal status.


Nick's right about this.  It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than
permission.  Not many people remember that Britain's King George III
expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian
mountains.  Said subjects basically said, ""Stop us if you can.""  He
couldn't.


That's how the USA started.  Of course, that's also how the Bolivarian
Republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn't have
quite the staying power of the USA.  I'm sure there are more examples of
going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right
now.


Or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to
carry out as ""scientific research"" which just coincidentally requires
the recovery of megatonnes of minerals (or whatever), then go at it.


Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya (I think) in
the late '70's for his commercial space launch project (one of the very
earliest).  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise
missiles in Africa, which made Libya renege on the arrangement.

HST is about 25,500 lbs (11,600 kg).  That doesn't include the cradle that
would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed.  Spacelab-J on STS-47
was 21,861 lbs (according to the press-kit). 

As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some
reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this
was a planned for contingency.  This is not a problem for the shuttle,
though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site, they still have to go to
Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay.

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via

run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.
Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.
Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
sitting.

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.

I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more
expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.

"Wm Hathaway comments;



I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to
impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to
somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment
of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded
by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be
sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,
our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts
that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,
not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all
of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach
that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the
'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally
unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern
sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.
I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,
just because it has changed the way we strive.

BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make
it better.

with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies:
length of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural
concerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of

their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.

Who said ISA was necessary?  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth

You didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism
as standard IDE.  If transfer rate is limited by IDE, whether it's
interfaced to ISA, EISA or VLB matters not.

On mine, for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water, hands down.  If

: at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives
at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.

I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.

: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card
: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down

: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to
: come down in price.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:
easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or
Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.

: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented
: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for
expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The
following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:

A (partial?) list:
	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently.
	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)
	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For
	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor
	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will
	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the
	termination, plug it in, and away it goes.
	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:
	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very
	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.

One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've
added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive
all on the same card.  

Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.

I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually _fits_.
HG makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made
by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they
ever made.

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot
of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather,
made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose
area, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard
to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want
to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like
BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but
fit is iffy.

A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing.  Don't know what they
finally decided.

I disagree.  It think the average joe is interested/curious about spaceflight
but sees it as an elitist activity.  Not one which he is ever going to
participate in.


Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details
of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should
be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it.
If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication.


As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering
the microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic
chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them
efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from
plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have
to orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use 
technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of 
using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies
bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in 
dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in 
hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is 
stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So 
now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar
interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's
what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.
We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.


First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information
out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.
This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then
we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.


Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,
I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search 
first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data
base itself could be useful for future engineers.

If we assume 6% inflation since 1969, that $25B would be worth about $100B
GD reckon a moon mission today could cost only $10B. Thats a factor of ten
reduction in cost. It might be possible to reduce that number futher by

Lindbergh's flight took place in '27, not the thirties.


Could you give examples of privately funded ones?


Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the
concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I 
suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic 
benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a
human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic
benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed
and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the 
equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion
for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done
than because they expect to make money off the deal.",lindbergh flight take place 27 not thirty could give example privately fund one logic certainly apply standard investment strategy however concept prize difficult goal do different reason suspect not aware mr orteig receive significant economic benefit lindbergh flight modern analogy prize human power helicopter face similar argument little economic benefit thing advantage come new approach develop fact prize frequently generate far work equivalent amount direct investment would person put x billion moon base much likely want see do expect make money deal,2,sci.space

It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.
The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.

The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.
It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it

"To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..
  
From the March 1993 ""Aero Vision"" (The newsletter for the Employees
of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).
  
  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY
  
  ""On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.
  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.
  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and
  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed
  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force
  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for
  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were
  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria
  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the
  cafeteria.
  
  Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the
  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the
  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude
  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational
  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social
  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available
  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything
  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.
  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-
  7302.""

"In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review
section there was a report of a group called ""Space Marketing""
in Atlanta, Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide
reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large
and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising.
There was an editorial about this in the Times the following
Tuesday.

Are others as upset about this as I am?  I feel that a global
boycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good
idea.  Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries
around the world?  Do others agree?

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the
order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (Higher orbits last
longer.)  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental
aspects of their advertising.  Fred's argument is roughly akin to
saying that it's bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn't advertise in
newspapers.  Think that through, Fred.

Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure,
filled with ""bio-degradable"" foam instead of gas.  It scoops up space
debris as it orbits, thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing
you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time.  Because of the large
drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a
year.

Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does
not burn up during entry.  It contains the electronics and propulsion
system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science
experiments proposed and built by high school students in
advertiser-sponsored science fairs.

Advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of
tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  The avionics can
reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different
parts of the globe.  Clever programming allows different languages
to every country.

During orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface,
and small lights are revealed.  The lights spell out messages for all
to see.

"As summer approaches, the usual preparations are being made...

Me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local
state forests. For that I was planning to get a backpack/rucksack. 
The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike, given
the metal frame and all. I have a big backrest (approx 12"" high) and
was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.

Any one have any experiences on such experimentation?

Taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully
loaded with a full load (40lbs). Is the load distribution going to 
be very severly affected? How will the bike perform with such a load 
clinging to the back rest. If I really secure it, with no shifting, 
do I still increase my chances of surfing?


Collective r.m. wisdom requested.  


p.s. I really can't afford leather pants. Boots and jeans are
all I can make do with. What you think of the knee protectors

I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics

good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very

faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz

                           April 16 - 22, 1993


SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test
and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were
performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter
antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis
is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed
information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.

3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)
advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone
70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees
to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.

5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance
measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC
measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and
currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with
the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.

6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 184 hours


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)
	Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds

was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at
night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,

Well maintained chains, running in oil, without those little rubber 'O' rings 
to cause frictional losses, might reach 99% efficiency.  The average open to

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better
performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.


Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that
are written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big
deal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to
fight with any low memory problems either.",see also onboard bio enable use 2 hard drive directly do 2 drive do limitation problem ide standard matter software driver often allow well performance though use want use device besides hard disk 2 disk obviously not able use 16bit real mode biose write do need software driver not big deal long driver available not fight low memory problem either,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means ""slow down"".

Seriously, concentrate on being very smooth, and you will make her
experience much more enjoyable.  Even a normal upshift causes your
passenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the
clutch to eliminate this.  It's more work, but your passenger will
appreciate it!  Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normal
helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which
makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.  If you're going
sport riding, have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves
against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your
arms.  (Again your bike will dive less too)

From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet,
the instrument payload constraints are:
    Mass allocation -  7 kilograms (15.4 lbs)
    Power allocation - 6 watts
    Required instruments:
	Visible imaging system (1024x1024 CCD, 750 mm fl, f/10 optics)
	IR mapping spectrometer (256x256 HgCdTe array, 0.3% energy resolution)
	UV spectrometer (55-200 nm, 0.5 nm resolution)
	Radio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system)
		ultrastable means 10^-14.

This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated
to the  mission of the spacecraft.  In addition, the power will come
from a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will
be about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be
strong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the
background, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.

It would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is looking
in to it.

"since at least one other person was interested in this:

my FZR's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired.
yesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an
hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand.  sprayed on paint.  thought
about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that
i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month.

soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder
coating, while extremely durable, will not handle over ~600 degree
temperatures.  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with
some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldn't
be available for months at least.  they directed me to another shop that
specializes in header coating.

the other shop said they have 2 coatings available.  one is aluminized that
can do 1200+ degrees and is ""comparable"" to powder coating for durability.
the other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800+ degrees (!) but is
thinner and not as durable.  both coatings have a textured finish (not
super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush.

price for 4 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot 4-2-1 collector was ~$100.  i'm
planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (UPS) next week maybe

I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm

But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly

That is, if the special software is free, like Xfree86.  There are
vendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices.  But
then, they charge $$$$.


I think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying).  This still
violates the FSF's policy of publically available code.


While this is true, there are fixes for those who have already
bought Diamond cards.  In Linux, for example, there are utilities
that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course,
this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this
will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.

I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card
for specialized free software, avoid Diamond.  But if you already
have one, there may be a fix that can help you.

there is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between
the handlbars and the rear-mounted jets is completely arbitrary
(simple linkage could make it work either way).


It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion
than snow skis.  But it *has* been an amusing digression.

IDE does not do DMA.  This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk
interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main
memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not

Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE
drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble.

(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the
last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it
would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)",ide not dma like te pc hard disk interface controller move sector buffer memory controller card cpu move datum buffer main memory need ide not work way not compatible heck ide use dma would hear kind complaint isa bus system 16 m ram not work ide drive 16 m dma address limit isa bus ide dma would trouble btw dmaenabling signal ide cable spec last report heard never implement would require different kind ide adapter different driver,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Unfortunately, if you launch this from the US (or are a US citizen),
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space
Transportation, and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for
an antisatellite weapon... :-)

The threshold at which OCST licensing kicks in is roughly 100km.

Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length
of the daylight.  You should be able to convert the information here
to sunrise and sunset times.

======================================================================
Definitions:

z = the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its
orbital plane.  In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think.
I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost
90 degrees.

u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.
Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.

a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from
0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.
The spring equinox occurs at a=0.

L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).
On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees)
L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.

Computation:
Define the auxiliary angles p and q by:
sin p = sin a sin z
cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)

Conclusion:
L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees)
L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)

Wait!  But what is h?
The cutoff function h is defined as follows:

h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1
      = 1    if   s > 1
      = -1   if   s < 1

As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows
how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.
Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.
Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below
the arctic circle.

Back in my youth (ahem) the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated up
water from a 12V source.  It was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my
RD350B.  It worked OK apart from one slight problem: we had to keep the revs 
above 7000.  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.

It made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow.  We would plot routes that
contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
get the water to boiling point.  This is sometimes difficult in England.

Good luck on your quest.

"I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am
running Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my
flatmates' games.

My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9
Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.

Basically I have two choices

1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or
2) Get some sort of 486.

Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high.
The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at
this price for a SX-25.

I have a couple of questions.

1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a
386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point
operations.

2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?

Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for
AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?

	Any experiences will be most helpful ...

		Kenny.

PS. Example prices:

I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The
HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this
reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-
ing to replace it for exactly this reason.

Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA
DMA.

Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using
mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a
EISA SCSI host adapter.

ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.


INTRODUCTION

    A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and
    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.
    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the
    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as
    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on
    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP
    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via
    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions
    on how to make requests.

    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames
    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.

    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is
    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.


VIEWING IMAGES

    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly
    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To
    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,
    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP
    sites.

    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image
    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document
    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at
    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory
    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.


ONLINE ARCHIVES

    NASA AMES

    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via
    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and
    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press
    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please
    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.

    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in
    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the
    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).

    To access the archives by email, send a letter to
    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

	send SPACE Index
	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.

    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in
    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use
    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this
    section for images or programs.

    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image
    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The
    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are
    available in these collections.

    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory
    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in
    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is
    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).

    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to
    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing
    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.

    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee
    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).


    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM

    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and
    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data
    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140
    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can
    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS
    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,
    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to
    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,
    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.

    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to
    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and
    ""QuickStart"" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu

    NASA SPACELINK

    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center
    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for
    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current
    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and
    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom
    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a
    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA
    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it
    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments
    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered
    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by
    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during
    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop
    between the user and NASA.

    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs
    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images
    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.

    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8
    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov
    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the
    Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.

    Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in
    directory SPACELINK.


    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)

    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for
    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and
    log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending
    email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.

    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
    no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
    carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
    more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
    password).

    The system is menu-driven; topics available as of 3/93 are:

	1   -	Master Directory - NASA & Global Change
	2   -	Personnel Information Management System
	3   -	Nimbus-7 GRID TOMS Data
	4   -	Interplanetary Medium Data (OMNI)
	5   -	Request data and/or information from NSSDC
	6   -	Geophysical Models
	7   -	CANOPUS Newsletter
	8   -	International Ultraviolet Explorer Data Request
	9   -	CZCS Browse and Order Utility
	10  -	Astronomical Data Center (ADC)
	11  -	STEP Bulletin Board Service
	12  -	Standards and Technology Information System
	13  -	Planetary Science & Magellan Project Information
	14  -	Other Online Data Services at NSSDC
	15  -	CD-ROMS Available at NSSDC

    For users with Internet access, datasets are made available via
    anonymous FTP once you select the desired datasets from the online
    catalog. For other users, data may be ordered on CD-ROM and in other
    formats. Among the many types of data available are Voyager, Magellan,
    and other planetary images, Earth observation data, and star catalogs.
    Viewers for Macintosh and IBM systems are also available. As an example
    of the cost, an 8 CD set of Voyager images is $75. Data may ordered
    online, by email, or by physical mail. The postal address is:

    SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SERVICE

    stsci.edu (130.167.1.2) has a large amount of information about the
    Hubble Space Telescope available by anonymous FTP, such as status
    reports and newsletters, in addition to material oriented towards HST
    observers and proposers. Get the top level README file to begin with.
    Contact Pete Reppert (reppert@stsci.edu) or Chris O'Dea
    (odea@stsci.edu).


    STARCAT

    The Space Telescope European Coordination Facility, at ESO/Garching
    provides on-line access to a huge astronomical database, featuring

	- Observation log files of several satellites/telescopes
	    (IUE,IRAS,HST,NTT...).
	- Spectra and images (IUE, HST).
	- Most of the astronomical catalogues (SAO, HR, NGC, PPM, IRAS,
	    Veron, GSC and many others, more than 50) in a very convenient
	    way (give center+radius+kind of objects, and you get the
	    corresponding files!).

    Log on as ``starcat'' (no password) on node stesis.hq.eso.org
    (134.171.8.100) or on STESIS (DECnet). The files created can be
    retreived by FTP. Contact: Benoit Pirenne, bpirenne@eso.org (phone +49
    89 320 06 433) at ST-ECF


    ASTRONOMICAL DATABASES

    The full SAO stellar database is *NOT* available online, probably due to
    the 40 MB size. It may be ordered on magnetic tape from the NSSDC. A
    subset containing position and magnitude only is available by FTP (see
    ""Astronomy Programs"" below).

    nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) has a large collection of astronomical
    programs for many types of computers, databases of stars and deep sky
    objects, and general astronomy information in directory /pub/astro. This
    site is mainly for European users, but overseas connections are
    possible.

    The Ames archives contain a database of 8,436 galaxies including name,
    RA, declination, magnitude, and radial velocity in MISC/galaxy.dat.
    Supplied by Wayne Hayes (wayne@csri.utoronto.ca).

    iris1.ucis.dal.ca (129.173.18.107) has a number of GIFs from Voyager,
    Hubble, and other sources available by anonymous FTP in pub/gif (most of
    this data is also in SPACE/GIF on the Ames server). Please restrict
    access to 5pm - 8am Atlantic time.

    pomona.claremont.edu has the Yale Bright Star catalog for anonymous FTP
    in directory [.YALE_BSC]. Contact James Dishaw
    (jdishaw@hmcvax.claremont.edu).

    The Hubble Guide Star catalog is available on CD-ROM for the Mac and PC
    for $49.95 US (catalog # ST101).

    For German (and possibly other European) readers, Jost Jahn has a
    service to distribute astronomical data to interested amateurs at cost.
    About 30-40 catalogs are available for DM 6..8/disk. Several floppy disk
    formats are available. Because of the expense of receiving email on his
    system, he asks that you contact him by physical mail:

    The ""Variable Stars Analysis Software Archive"" is available via
    anonymous FTP from kauri.vuw.ac.nz (130.195.11.3) in directory
    pub/astrophys. This is intended for specialists in this field, and they
    would appreciate people from outside New Zealand confining their FTP
    access to the astrophys directory, as they pay a significant amount for
    Internet access. Contents are relatively sparse at present due to the
    youth of the archive - contributions are encouraged. Contact the archive
    administrator, Timothy Banks (bankst@kauri.vuw.ac.nz) for more
    information.

    The ""IDL Astronomy Users Library"" is available by anonymous FTP from
    idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.57.82). This is a central repository for
    general purpose astronomy procedures written in IDL, a commercial image
    processing, plotting, and programming language. Contact Wayne Landsman
    (landsman@stars.gsfc.nasa.gov) for more information.


    ORBITAL ELEMENT SETS

    The most recent orbital elements from the NASA Prediction Bulletins are
    carried on the Celestial BBS, (513)-427-0674. Documentation and tracking
    software are also available on this system. The Celestial BBS may be
    accessed 24 hours/day at 300, 1200, or 2400 baud using 8 data bits, 1
    stop bit, no parity.

    Orbital element sets are available via anonymous FTP from the
    following sites:

    archive.afit.af.mil (129.92.1.66)	    NASA,TVRO,Shuttle
    directory: /pub/space

    SPACE DIGEST ARCHIVES

    Copies of back issues of Space Digest are archived on
    LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET. Send mail containing the message ""INDEX SPACE"" to
    get an index of files; send it the message ""GET filename filetype"" to
    get a particular file.


LANDSAT AND NASA PHOTOS

    You can get black-and-white 1:1M prints, negatives, or positives for
    $10, $18, $12 respectively for any Landsat data more than 2 years old
    from EDC, (Eros (Earth Resources Orbiting Satellite) Data Center). Call
    them at (605)-594-6511. You get 80 meter resolution from the MSS
    scanner, 135x180 kilometers on a picture 135x180 mm in size. I think you
    have to select one band from (green, red, near IR, second near IR), but
    I'm not sure. Digitial data is also available at higher prices.

    Transparencies of all NASA photos available to the public can be
    borrowed from the NASA photo archive; you can have copies or prints
    made.

PLANETARY MAPS

    The USGS address for maps of the planets is:

    U.S. Geological Survey,
    Distribution Branch,
    Box 25286, Federal Center, Bldg. 41
    Denver, CO 80225

    Maps cost $2.40 to $3.10 per sheet (a few come in sets of 2 or 3 sheets).

    The best global maps of Mars based on Viking images are 1:15,000,000
    scale in 3 sheets. These maps are:

    I-1535 (2 sheets only) - relief, albedo, names
    I-1535
    I-1618 (3 sheets) - relief, names
    I-2030 (3 sheets) - relief, topographic contours
    I-1802-A,B,C (3 sheets) - geology

    There are many other maps as well: 30 sheets at 1:5,000,000 scale in
    relief, albedo, geology, photomosaic forms (not all 30 sheets available
    in all formats); 140 sheets at 1:2,000,000 scale as photomosaics of the
    whole planet, about 100 sheets of interesting sites at 1:500,000 scale
    in photomosaic format, and lots of special sheets.

    Then there are maps of Mercury, Venus, the Moon, the four Galilean
    Satellites, six moons of Saturn and five of Uranus. [Phil Stooke
    (stooke@vaxr.sscl.uwo.ca), the author of this item, has offered to
    respond to email requests for information on any topic relating to lunar
    and planetary maps.]


COMETARY ORBIT DATA

    The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and the Minor Planet
    Center announce the sixth edition of the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits in
    IAU Circular 4935. The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent
    all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long.
    Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00
    while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII
    along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate
    ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of
    $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue
    alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for
    $300.00.

    Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic
    media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion
    non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may
    not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more
    expensive than those given. Mail requests for specific information and
    orders to:

Ok, so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy
computer algorythims, but have you looked ad the Hubble results, the
defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software (see
those jupiter pictures for results), but is the effects are completely
reversable, why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it?

The way I see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in
the butt if i'm out of the ball park), the astromers are making the
best of limited possiblities, there's only one hubble, and the shuttle
makes another in the near future a non-thought.  Perhaps those self
same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind
mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's (if that is what is used)
and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope...

"Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it:

(Caution: speculation mode engaged)
There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.
I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed
items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would
have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due
to thermal cycle stresses...)

I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are
much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged
(I assume that they were caged for launch)?

I would have to say that the ""greatest philosopher"" title would have to
go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially
defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did 
definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it
was Descartes who said that ""All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.""

If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances
in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.
This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as ""the philosopher"".

Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his
ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful
that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years
from now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.

As for ""modern"" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most
influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who
came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and 
amplified them over time).

I would say that the most influential ""american"" philosopher would have to
be Dewey.

But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in
500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect
was ""American"", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.",would say great philosopher title would go plato since whole enterprise philosophy essentially define although get answer wrong definitively identify important question think descarte say philosophy footnote plato choose philosopher make important advance human knowledge lifetime simpleit aristotle much case many simply refer philosopher regard nietzsche one entertaining although since idea fragment since life cut short doubtful influence philosopher likely extensive 500 year probably still read 500 year though modern philosopher would say kant influential since strong influence almost everyone come unfortunately maintain error amplify time would say influential american philosopher would dewey question philosopher highly regard 500 year may well ayn rand every important respect american bear russia guess remains see,2,sci.space

because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern, 
ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed
orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The
opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based
telescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through
the field doesn't ruin observations. If that were the case, the

IBM, Apple, Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor


The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week, as Motorola
Corp., IBM, and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong
effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit
processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s
Pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50
SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance
for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89
performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down
version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000
workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
built in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the
Micro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop
PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,
including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source
noted.

According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive
architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to
be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s
486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one

ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI.

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s
and that is ALL you have right about SCSI
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too.
SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 
By your OWN data the ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI"" is correct
With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed
""20% faster than IDE"" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been
posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on 
sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as 
mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}

Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip
an Apple salesperson said ""it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip"" {Not at a 6MB/s,
10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see
SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven
in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH
FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.",show not know much scsi scsi1 scsi1 controler chip range indeed 05mb right scsi scsi1 scsi2 controller chip 46mb 10mb burst 8bit note increase speed mac quadra use version scsi1 exist pc use set scsi2 8bitscsi1 mode 46mb 10mb burst scsi2 16bitwide fast mode 812mbs 20mb burst scsi2 32bitwide fast 1520mb 40mb burst datum although scsi twice fast esdi correct scsi2 controller chip scsi1 reach 10mb indeed 20 fast ide 120 83 996 scsi fact post newsgroup mac ibm info sheet available ftp sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 infomacreport macibmcompareversion txt 173 161 may still part problem mac ibm pc inconsiant scsi though well document quadra scsi2 chip apple salesperson say use fast scsi1 chip not 6mb 10mb burst not scsi1 5mbs maximum synchronous quadra use ansynchronous scsi slow seem mac ibm see scsi1 interface think iscsi1 maybe scsi1 interface drive machine scsi2 controller chip 8bit mode much fast true scsi1 go,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

don't know why it would do this, unless you're out of paper, that is.


when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power

Ocean Reconnaissance Launch Surprises West
Space News, April 5-11, 1993, p.2
[Excerpts]
     Russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months 
March 30, confounding Western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead. 
     The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from 
Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission. 
     However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers 
identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic 
emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement. 
     Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England... [said]  Western 
observers had concluded that no more would be launched. But days after the 
last [such] satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, Cosmos 2238 was 
launched.

........
WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC

1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE ""SPINOFFS"" WE WERE PROMISED?
In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""The
Man Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future.  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged
for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth
orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This
may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of
Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.
..........

What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.
What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).
Is NASA really supporting this junk?
Are protesting groups being organized in the States?

I don't care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single

wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at 
Marquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or
Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance
that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our
University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did
not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead
to be a legitimate charge.


I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that
any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.


No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee
of the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dont
better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.
Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
at a place where everything is overhead.


Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally
demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being 
selective with the facts again.


If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your
""friend"" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year ""if the wrap were gone"". This merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.

If you had been looking in your mirror, you would have seen the guy coming 
before you heard the screeching tires.

When you're stopped at a light:

1)  Stop so that you're got space in front of you, and a quick easy escape
route (between lanes, into a crosswalk, up a driveway, somewhere) if someone
decides they want to plow into you.

2)  Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars
are stopped behind you, so you don't have to waste a second you don't have
trying to get it in gear if you need to move.

3)  Watch your mirrors.  In that situation, most of the hazards you are 
trying to avoid are coming from behind you.  SIPDE (<-- msf-geek-speak)
isn't just for when you're moving.  And you're less likely to panic and stall
the bike if you've got time to prepare before the guy's tires lock up behind
you.  (You still get the bejeezus scared out of you, but it's more a feeling
of quickly-rising dread than a sudden jolt.)

It may be that they just didn't mention it, or that they actually haven't 
thought about it.  I got the vague impression from their mission proposal
that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They
seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without 
explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application
I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That's
great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically.

The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these
2 wires will be found on all 17"" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17"",
Sony 1604, etc).  On 14"" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire.

Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the
sharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines.

The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube,
has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in 
a flatter screen than other 17"" monitors using the standard trinitron 
(which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and 
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.

"Hola amigos,

Quiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and
smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great
brakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but
great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but
I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs.  

Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They
do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage
to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...
accelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does
anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.

By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes
there, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson

"Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!

 BACKGROUND
 ----------

 The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions 
 devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad 
 interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, 
 roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,
 motosports enthusiasts.

 The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little
 over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from
 New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada
 Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.

 The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need 
 to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of 
 performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise 
 ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.

 Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to 
 issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be ""flame-free"".  

 HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION
 ---------------------------------

 You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:


        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day
 (depending on the topic). 

   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the
       list directly.
 
 After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive
 an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner
 so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in
 order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.
 
 Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily
 or digest distribution (as per your initial request).

 HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION
 ----------------------------------

 It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a
 single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out 
 whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the
 frequency of postings this appears to be about every other
 day.

 Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every 
 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:


        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 HOW TO POST TO THE LIST
 -----------------------

 This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:


        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may
 not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it
 (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)
 you can include a ""metoo"" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX
 based mail systems). 

 BOUNCES
 -------

 Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace
 the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with
 bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,
 sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of
 employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive
 bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and
 if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I
 administer this list) contact me through my administration
 hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

"I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

   Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody
in interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'),
what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation field?""

   If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and 
molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far
from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS
and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings
""Interstellar Processes"", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr.,
published in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and 
Black.

   Inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit
from place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association,
I would guess).  Outside the galaxy, of course, things aren't so 
varied.

   I hope this is what you were looking for....

Nope, you're confusing separate programs.  Atlas was the first-generation
US ICBM; Titan I was the second-generation one; Titan II, which all the
Titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM.  There
was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.

(Yes, *three* programs.  Despite the similarity of names, Titan I and
Titan II were completely different missiles.  They didn't even use the
same fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.)

"The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1
beta. Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer.
If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the
Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic
cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) 

So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and
REM out the Adaptec drivers.

Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM
nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out
the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the
right order.. it will work.

Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2
will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you
are off to more REM statements and more fun. 

The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that
do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be
configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use
multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be
able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

     Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years. 

     My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In 
particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in 
altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude 
of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 
March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the 
limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.) 

    This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 
degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But 
it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation.

this small program that prints the ""Non-System Disk"" error, not DOS.  If
this program tries to transfer control to a BIOS location that is

I don't think that the BIOS is overwritten, there is usually a small routine

   _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
   no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
   to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
   ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
   by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
   least it was a good try...

So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?
Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
models.

A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this
paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject
line 
  get 9304001


Here is the abstract of that paper.

   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them
   at cosmological distances;
   but as long as there is no distance
   indicator to these events all possible sources which are
   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
   although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
   originate in the solar cometary cloud
   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

   We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE
   catalogue up to March, 1992), and
   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to
   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations
   between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,
   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,
   at least to some extent, true variations
   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$
   test to both distributions.",problem oort cloud source absolutely plausible mechanism propose would involve new physics far tell close conventional oort source model bfield pinching comet get many hole count least good try plausible model grb astronomical distance recent observation rule merge neutron star hypothesis lot problem anyhow look implausible model fundamentally allow independent model paper possibility grb oort cloud come astrophysic abstract service get copy paper send message astrophbabbagesissait subject line get 9304001 abstract paper currently favor explanation origin grb put cosmological distance long distance indicator event possible source isotropically distribute remain consideration oort cloud comet keep list although know mechanism generating grb cometary nucleus unlikely may seem possibility grb originate solar cometary cloud not exclude disprove use available datum distribution grb batse catalogue march 1992 catalogue cometary orbit marsden william 1992 investigate whether observational indication correlation angular distribution grb comet aphelion assume distribution aphelia direction reflect least extent true variation column density oort cloud also apply vov test distribution,2,sci.space

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate
project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop
your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against
your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No
other demand is necessary.


You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch
system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on
exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project
start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,
the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want
speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in
service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less
than 18 months after the development go-ahead.",assume lowcost delivery system separate project spend hundred million dollar hope win billiondollar prize cheap develop launch system charge entire development cost contest entry try exist launcher demand necessary assume going take decade build new launch system saturn v take less six year depend exactly date start pegasus take three project start first flight sdio chickene orbital development target date orbital dcy flight 1996 really want speed consider first prototype thor missile still service core delta launcher ship usaf less 18 month development goahead,2,sci.space

                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                             POST-LAUNCH
                         April 9 - 15, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)
swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.

2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.

3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data; long term trend analysis is continuing.

6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level.

7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.
Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.

8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads
19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 260 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21
(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was
not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of
the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)
	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds

Some will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don't know how much
the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the
tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way,
and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course.
I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only
started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed
(off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been.

I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during
the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student
would take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the
""you are a sack of potatoes"" passenger speech, the instructor would steer
the bike and make a general nuisance of himself. It was amusing to watch,

Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps
but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar
to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share
of GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to
be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious
if you thought about it.


It is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but
they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.


Too true! But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry.

The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of
the orbit of Mercury.

The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed
perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to
Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations
and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later
improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system
of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune
and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit
of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was
afoot with Mercury.

But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate
it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly
curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915
and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics
of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian 
geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of
it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession
of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's
numbers rather than Leverrier's.)

Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent
efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar
have been fruitless.

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy
undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him
taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street
outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)

However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of
streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only
illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a
bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level
is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected
local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable
success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At
least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.
( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )

I suppose that the ""right"" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,
but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially
yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although
I do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.",hear prof mcnally day astronomy undergraduate denouncing photon pollution easy imagine take practical step modify sodium lamp street outside mill hill observatory 12gauge shotgun however seriously possible limit effect streetlight add reflector light illuminate ground need bonus power consumption require give illumination level reduce strangely enough astronomer often seek lobby elect local authority use light system considerable success desert area around major we observatory least that s mcnally tell we year ago british local authority could nt care less far see suppose right dark sky aspiration worthwhile one illuminate orbital billboard seem especially yukky presumably area international law although find idea right bear antisatellite weapon intrigue,2,sci.space

Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.
It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.




Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have
paging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is
cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more
memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).


The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from
0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the
same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed
(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is
lousy.


The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come
out. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.

problems to bring it back and they'd do it again.  It seems that many of
those 30AH batteries were DOA, near-DOA, and always unlikely to be going

bad ones, and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones.  BMW

"Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:
                          The Next Step
                          
        The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase 
Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many
congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,
for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best
possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his
position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,
Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long
record of support and interest in space development, and helped
pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements
Act.                      
        There is a small group of activists in southern California 
who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.
We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown
about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space
constituents to let him know that they care about getting
America back to the Moon.
        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert 
for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him
introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late
spring, 1993.
        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's
office. As more is known, it will be passed on.
        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support
the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For
any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:
either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an
issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be
propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or
have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but
widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,
by necessity, must choose.                    
        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources 
Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number
of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish
this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support
the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the
bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a
congressperson's staff review a bill.
        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet
introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently
written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists
and politicians.
        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please
request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service
address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space

More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably
a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and

my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test
only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the

it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment

I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation
is no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to

There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:

The second bank is labeled ""IRQ"" and has the following labels:
5C
5S

I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the ""G"" enables the game port and
the ""S2"" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I
have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that
this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t

There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much
expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it
from someone else.

However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.
This is because the MPU used ""speed buffering"" instead of having a
16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the ""speed buffering""
works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.

Hope this helps...

I hate to belabor the obvious once again, but if there had been an Orbiter
emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission, they
would have HAD to land with HST in the bay. 

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that
they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one
that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  
I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was
as short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper
envelope of what the Shuttle can do.

I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought 
down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,
cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in
addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment 
mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second 
time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a 
few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two 
servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down 
and take it up again.",hate belabor obvious orbiter emergency early stage original hst deployment mission would land hst bay indeed worry one concern possibility would lose motor something way make orbit one low give hst useful lifetime atmospheric drag believe decision deploy hst even project lifetime short six month fact get excellent orbit upper envelope shuttle never hear serious consideration hst might bring refurbishment would horrendous cost transport clean reteste recertifye hardware ground addition lose observe time cost second deployment mission risk might not get good orbit second time would probably still need third servicing mission year gyro component wear well two servicing mission space could well happen bring hst take,2,sci.space

 My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny
 masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the
 problem.   Or, to put it more technically, the extra ""volume"" they add
 to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.
 
 Jupiter is 2E27 kg, while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23.
 
 Also, as I said, the few references that I've looked at do not
 mention outgassing or breakup as important processes.  The important
 thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet ""reverse slingshot"" that leads to a
 weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).",poor old physics intuition surprise tiny masse sit close jupiter play role whatsoever problem put technically extra volume add phase space possible capture trajectory negligible jupiter 2e27 kg galilean satellite around 1e23 also say reference looked not mention outgassing breakup important process important thing jupitersuncomet reverse slingshot lead weakly jupiterbound orbit comet least temporary one,2,sci.space

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this

Pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.  

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less
than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain
and reschedule the EVA's in that time.

More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and
AXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle,
there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.

parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from 
the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else
into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the 
ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of
the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a
bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.

Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could 
think was ""big"".  Then I put one foot up.  ""Heavy"" came to mind very
quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to 
tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.

By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even
on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that 
did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is
on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north
of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95
splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access
highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, 
Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.
On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about
30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many
thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.

Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along
in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane 
changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this 
thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was
non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.
Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,
but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless
buzz.

The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the
brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,
decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  
The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok
in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack
oft featured in ""Spencer for Hire"" -- a place where you could really 
find ""Spencer"", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting
through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.

About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal
for ""hold on tight"".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second
gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a 
short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light
traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.
Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort
lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went 
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed
there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, 
I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.

Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the ""get
off in a mile"" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted
to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were
several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the 
slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could 
see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed
to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put
the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side
stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.


My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,
hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than 
list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.",sixteen day put test drive honda st1100 finally 17th saturday without much rain fact clear become warm sunny wind die three week ago take long cool ride hawk cycle 128 test ride sell deliver demo st1100 fifteen hour arrive demo vfr bikelocke showroom surround 150 bike not likely move soon today different even bike 50 use dirt bike 50 use street bike 35 car big tent full outlandishly fat touring bike trailer squeeze parking lot sort fat bike convention shelly dave run one msf course time one classroom one back lot plus usuall free cookout food cycle give away every weekend summer hmmm seem like big moto party ten minute look rob c cheif sale slime another 5 minute read sign long disclosurelibility praytogod form help jt push st mess parking lot go control put tank bag hawk right saddlebag wife put everything else leave saddlebag that s nice helped push st lot think good jt move edge road away 100 bike 100 people ride like bicycle ca nt heavy thought well wrong sit st foot could think big put one foot heavy come mind quickly cindy back back hard tell seat three time large hawk seat bike seem nearly control idle side road 3000 rpm second gear weight seem dissappear even bike 41 mile odometer slippery new tire pad not yet bite disk thing seem smooth sure cycle section 128 folk ever ride 30 mile north computer concentration five mile north i95 split away 128 lighly travel two lane limited access highway go heavily forest section hamilton manchesterbythesea newbury way gloucester way meet 133 road wind sea 30 mile inland andover way go many thoroughly new england spot perfect slow sport touring section cindy difficulty speed 3rd gear 4th gear purr along top gear thing less low rpm grunt hawk lane change new experience big heft require move thing respond well though wallow complaint behind fair fairly quiet helmet buffet nontrivial top gear car pass 85 mph nearly effortless smooth smooth smooth not sure v4 sound remind pleasant bar not transmit endless buzz jump 133 cause less impressed brake hill reverse camber twicereverse radius decrease radius turn real squeeze need front binder section 133 tight urban st work ok section show weight go clam shack oft featured spencer hire place could really find spencer house 15 mile 133 put traffic turn go back 128 half way onramp yank cindy wrist singal hold tight head check leave time find redline second gear give good shove third fourth see dod speed short shift top way 133 see cop light traffic not cross dod zone bike new well 25 mile ok try high effort lane change wide sweeping turn time wick go buffet threating pull we seat stay comfortable wind steering look find indicate 135 mph not bad 2up touring beverly come fast twice post limit get mile sign roll throttle coast want readjust come slowness good idea several manholesize patch sand exit ramp back slow heavy behavior cycle mile 128 could see even car stack outside right got manage thread st car edge concrete pad front heavy take way much effort cindy put thing center stand sure used side stand st would side within minute demo opinion heavy put diet smooth comfortable hardly notice dod speed would buy 3000 less list like much bike,1,rec.motorcycles

"MG>> 	I went buying SIMMs recently, and the sales person told me that 
the
MG>> are 9-chip SIMMs and 3-chip SIMMs, and one cannot use them interchan
MG>> If you use one, you have to use all of the same type.

don't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them 
between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless 
they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one 
bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that 
the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent 
configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit 
nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte 
).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent 
because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM 
interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry 
if too techie for ya].


MG>> 	Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to

MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my

That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit 
wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  
Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit 
CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data 
from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when 
it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard 
links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in 
this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means 
that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you 
have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide 
data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks 
are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data 
with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by 
one SIMM at a time.

Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your 
question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'

Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17"" monitors recently
and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if
you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality.
This monitor can be had for around $1070.

Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a
17"" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember
correctly, I think its viewing area is 16"" measured diagonally.

Thanks.

":  What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling? Couple hours after

It depends on how badly you want to live.  The FAA says ""eight hours, bottle
to throttle"" for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours.  The FARs specify
a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums.

keep your blood/alcohol level barely street-legal.  Coffee, hyperventilation

First off, with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit).
Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.
At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good
cohesive set of SCSI drivers.

Connecting devices
------------------
 
  Normally, a 7 wire connection is used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
	DTR1    to    DSR2
	DSR1    to    DTR2
	RTS1    to    CTS2
	CTS1    to    RTS2
  If a modem is connected, add lines for the following:
        RI, DCD
  If software wants it, connect DCD1 to CTS1 and DCD2 to CTS2.
  BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally
have those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2
to pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.
 
  If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection
can be used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
Additionally, connect (if software needs it):
        RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1
	RTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2
	DTR1    to    DSR1
	DTR2    to    DSR2
You won't need long wires for these!
  The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission
between two PCs (see software section for details).
  Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from
the PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals
and DSR & CTS are outputs!

"NASA Headquarters distributed the following press
release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you
folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently
discussed on sci.space are covered in this.

Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance

Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and
Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of
the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space
Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station.

A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7
billion and a high option of $9 billion will be
considered by the committee. Each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for
development, operations, utilization, Shuttle
integration, facilities, research operations support,
transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds.

Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within
the NASA budget for the President's new technology
investment. As a result, station options above $7
billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space
station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion
in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.

Gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee. Generally, the
members-designate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted. They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the Station Redesign Team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider.

Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and
Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give
""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process.

To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting
basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the
possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and
systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants
in assessing Russian systems and technology. The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities. Careful
integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal.

Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science, the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents.
However, he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in
the future of this industry and this nation.""",nasa headquarter distribute follow press release today 46 typed verbatim folk chew many topic recently discuss scispace cover gibbon outline space station redesign guidance dr john h gibbon director office science technology policy outline membersdesignate advisory committee redesign space station april 3 three budget option guidance committee deliberation redesign space station low option 5 billion midrange option 7 billion high option 9 billion consider committee option would cover total expenditure space station fiscal year 1994 1998 would include fund development operation utilization shuttle integration facility research operation support transition cost also must include adequate program reserve insure program implementation within available fund next 5 year 4 billion reserve within nasa budget president new technology investment result station option 7 billion must accompany offset reduction rest nasa budget example space station option 9 billion would require 2 billion offset nasa budget next 5 year gibbon present information organizational session advisory committee generally membersdesignate focus upon administrative topic use session get acquaint also receive legal ethic briefing orientation process station redesign team follow develop option advisory committee consider gibbon also announce united state international partner european japanese canadian decide consultation give full consideration use russian asset course space station redesign process end russian ask participate redesign effort asneede consult basis redesign team make use expertise assess capability mir possible use mir russian capability system we international partner hope benefit expertise russian participant assess russian system technology overall goal redesign effort develop option reduce station cost preserve key research exploration capability careful integration russian asset could key factor achieve goal gibbon reiterate president clinton commit redesign space station make every effort preserve science technology job space station program represent however also commit space station well manage one not consume national resource use invest future industry nation,2,sci.space

Robert,

You have probably solved your problem by now.  Anyway, if you can get your
hands on QA Plus (version 4.21, maybe others as well), it will let you write
the COMPAQ CMOS settings.  I know because I just did it. 

I was just about to search for such a diagnostic disk when my brother-in-law 
fixed an old DESKPRO with it.  You might try the simtel mirror FTP sites.",robert probably solve problem anyway get hand qa plus version 421 maybe other well let write compaq cmos setting know search diagnostic disk brotherinlaw fix old deskpro might try simtel mirror ftp site,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Yes only your $00.02.  Here's mine.

If I were running at a new chip at a Trade show, and had little to no real
technical knowledge,  I wouldn't let some stranger with a diskette boot my demo
machine.  If the demo machine is down too long people will not see my nice
demos, and if this purposted LINUX diskette is really something that will wipe
the disk, or is loaded with a VIRUS!, I'm in deep trouble.

No marketer in their right mind would let you do this, unless they had
specifically invited people to do so, and provided machines to do it with.

We can we learn : This technology will be shipping from PC vendors in May 1993,
and will be i486 compatible.

"From another space forum
    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56
 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers
 lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived
 the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot
 altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.

    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,

    ""It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've
 lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.""

    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a
 Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on
 April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the
 report and Discovery was launched with its ""extra payload"".  NASA
 officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th
 launch date.

    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB
 technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,
 its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a
 part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.

    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that
 the Shuttle processor will take ""appropriate action"".  Thiokol is a
 subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.

     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,
crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.

   Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are
   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?

   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   

Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the
gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that
GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population
(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic
halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)
(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was
probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)
	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo
population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is
ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you
have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism
of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start
to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.
	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution
(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with
the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence
isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-)
If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)
and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star
colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting
the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.

	If we know anything about physics at that level,
the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic
strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.

The situation is further complicated by recent claims that
there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS
they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the
NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]

   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering
   hyperspace :-)

   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered
   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

    Acer? Touch?

    What else should I ask?

    Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of

Hard Drive:
    Segate, Western Digital, Conner all have the same price. Which one is
    more liable? which one has better performace?

Case/power supply:
    Given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?

"I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with
my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.  
When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is
fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen 
gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a 3/4"" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can
manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just
shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't 
been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and
both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried
to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of
days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...
So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what
to do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm
not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.

Exactly. Some of the SPACE:1999 effects remain first-rate even today. 
 

Later on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some
of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in TV history by flying ""Into Infinity.""
This was a one-off thing done as part of BBC's ""educational SF"" series ""The
Day After Tomorrow."" The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of
reaching the speed of light (""lightship Altares""), the four-man crew eventually 
journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (I
think). I saw this as a 9-year-old back in 1976 and liked it very much, but
then again I was a fan of SPACE:1999 so I guess I was easily satisfied in those

I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) 
was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost
payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from
2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing
with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now
I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the 
successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early
results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in 
Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue 
their development. 

The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton 
is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D
which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about
launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which
are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things
up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile
thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.
Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know 
how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while
bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
and erected on the pad?  

They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads 
(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course
any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the
US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political
problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

Hell, just save your candle stubs and bring them.  Light them up, and
dribble the wax all over the kindling wood and light _that_.  Although
I like the belly-button lint / eggshell case idea the best, if you're
feeling particularly industrious some eventful evening.  Or you can
do what I did one soggy summer: open the fuel line, drain some onto a 
piece of rough or rotten wood, stick that into the middle of the soon-to-
be inferno and CAREFULLY strike a match... As Kurt Vonnegut titled one
of the latter chapters in Cat's Cradle, ""Ah-Whoom!""

Works like a charm every time :-)

"Now the bike is off warranty, I finally replaced the stock items on my
Softail Custom with the title ones. Installation was pretty easy in
both cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me!
 I discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buying
and making the requisite tools!

MC Ignitions Power Arc II Single Fire Ignition: easy to install, but
read the wiring diagram carefully!  Setting the static timing was a
piece of cake.  Once installed, I have found easier starting, smoother
idle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in the
exhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle  :-)
The folks at MC Ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions on
the phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.

S&S Super E Carb: installation easy, once I hacked down an Allen wrench
to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. Tunes like
a dream, just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was so
lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and even
backfiring into the intake manifold. The Super E is terrific, no
hesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no
need to rejet from the factory settings!

I know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchers
out there, but I had my bike in so many pieces this weekend I began to
get worried. But it all went back together again, and runs like a
dream, so I am feeling pretty happy.

Now all I have to do is install my BUB pipes and try to pass the NH

"This is maybe not a Pet Peeve, but definitely a Playmate Peeve:


Does this make anyone's Skeptic Alarm (tm) go off?  No offense, Bill, I
don't mean to say that you're not being straight, but I wonder how you
know about this?  Have you actually every used your secret method to break
all the different kinds of bike locks?  Or are you taking someone's word
for it?

The fact is, it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to
go into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in
rec.motorcycles.  So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can't
even protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out
with it.

See, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the
cordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method
(I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put
a rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a
truck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything.
Since that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or
cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on
to the next bike.

(Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-)


What tactic are you referring to?  If we don't know what you are talking about,
we can't very well guard against it, can we?

For my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm
with pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C
insurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people
about.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of
stealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious,
they'll set off the alarm.)

That's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its
actual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would
WANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make
a profit on the deal.  :-)

Seriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week,
and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking,
but useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a
curb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable
locks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or
the cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend
come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The
only thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over 
winter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).

Oh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and
place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.

That's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put
on bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound.  I like ABUS, since I have
personally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.",maybe not pet peeve definitely playmate peeve make anyone skeptic alarm tm go offense bill not mean say not straight wonder know actually every use secret method break different kind bike lock take someone word fact unlikely someone read anything go go successful bikestealing business read anything recmotorcycle please tell we talk not even protect assault discuss method not come see hear one pipe liquid nitrogen cordless dremel tool bunch one plausable method not bike thief really not know certain put rod wheel use four guy lift bike truck work people not lock bike anything since method childishly easy figure nice visible chain cable locking bike something likely make lazy thief go next bike hey finally advantage weight high cg concour tactic refer not know talk not well guard money literally rely combination motiondetector alarm pager earshot bike questionable area cc insurance try park obvious visible area lot people see someone play bike without intention steal least eye get rambunctious set alarm nice bike ratbike trick always keep actual value well bluebook look crappy nobody would want steal even stupid enough would make profit deal seriously instance need go business trip week sadly leave bike sit get shittylooking useable cover lock bike lock curb bumper parking lot light usually rig cable lock use aircraft cable anyone pull either bike cable join concour alarm go friend come buy every day look make sure still thing ever steal 60 cover winter storage battery bike thus alarm oh put eyelet cover lock pass place absolutely destroy cover get well think lock see people put bike look well not mechanically sound like abus since personally remove master lock locker boot,1,rec.motorcycles

Sure about that? Maybe Proxima might cause problems, but at Oort
Cloud distances AC a and AC b together look like a point source.

Besides, even the solar system's Oort cloud is unstable over
geologic time, right, and needs to be replentished from somewhere
else, like the short period comets of the Kupier Belt?

(Or maybe I'm misremembering something I read or heard somewhere...)


Until we're able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars
to detect planets, we won't know enough to say whether or not
a single star has planets. And we're likely to find out about the
close ones first.

Heck, if neutron stars can have planets, anything can have planets.
(Or was that discovery disconfirmed?)

"OK,

    I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin
by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,
it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at
first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,
the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 
900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the
rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)

So, what did I see?

(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineering
center today. It is white with light green stripes.)

Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a

White trash: ""White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the

	with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell.""
	-- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-

"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an
informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.
ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and
International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the
company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that
his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.

The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga
to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,
who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which 
the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,
His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought
there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous
satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,
seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of
slots.

The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl
Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions
supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 
70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).
According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the
world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and 
the Pacific Rim. 

RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax
haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to
fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have
cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.
Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began 
negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in 
Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.
Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way
that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  
Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the
only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.

Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost
of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg
says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who 
went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was
out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He
again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,
he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the 
Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions
before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to 
allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.

The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied 
Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in 
Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built
about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that
siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest
people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this
point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on
both siberians and midwesterners :-)

Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is 
apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that
would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them 
specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites
that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This
compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1
million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their 
satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They 
have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give
you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are
getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place
now.

Tidbits:

*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big
business because big business is just like what they have over there, except
that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""

*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch
within 9 months.

*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement
fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,
and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is
sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.

*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried
partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying
monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry 
because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what
really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.

*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering
money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting
25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in 
rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian
bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that
the only the contractors get swindled by the government.

*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western 
satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type
of satellites, which was rather reassuring.

*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive
technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have
a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare
well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much 
shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the 
difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,
shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer
technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date
hardware.

I talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the

used in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).  He wasn't aware 
of anything regarding self applied tape.

Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source?

  The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode,
which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800
does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should
be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s),
since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell
for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with
the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.
Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using
standard palette.

  BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs
vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to
take it myself).


  I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA
chip it uses though.

OK, here's my results so far....

1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support
   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)

2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.
   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)

3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.

OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder.

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting
the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.

There are 2 reasons for doing this

1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.

2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA
   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,
   I can get down to 1.

Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,
but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...

Wasn't there a ""plain"" flavor too?  They looked more like some

smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends.  Kinda scary.


An other post described it as like a ""microwaved Tootsie Roll"" --
which captures the texture pretty well.  As for taste, they were
like candy, only not very sweet -- does that make sense? I recall
liking them for their texture, not taste. I guess I have well
developed texture buds.

In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, I think their
cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO
is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G
range.


True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I
don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
risks involved.

If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures
100% of the available launch market, then I think you could
do it.

adopting a novel set of thought patterns and riding strategies while piloting

Also, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and

I bought a Maxtor 4380 300mb ESDI HDD from Hi-Tech for $300, then paid to
get it repaired, for about another $300.  Here's the deal:  The thing works
fine!  It low level formats, etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN...
(Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk
doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes.

Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and
correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: ""Ok, NDD's
just not being thurough enough, I'll use Spinrite, I heard that works well.""
What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!  
AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to
be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted
again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.

I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD, and I really
can't afford it.

I'm using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access
though, I know that can create problems).  The disk is using the second
option to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls,
and everything else selected is standard, maybe I need to use a different
head skew or something?  I don't know.

Ouch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers

I can't see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) ""mothership"" except
for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a
""Grand Tour"" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt 
that
the idea of a big ""mother ship"" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather
small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan
III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in
common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a
probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several
smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.
The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards
Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful
cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power
source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.
Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements
within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a
relatively great distance.
---
The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers,
and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in
the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during
the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the
same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in
addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining
that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have
enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several
other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune
systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to
trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space
probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a 
small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, 
well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer
planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of
course.

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on
PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.
(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow)
Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when
compared to IDE?


I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.


IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's
how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be
an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different
platforms.

Is there any argument that 
IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the
drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able
to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because
of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?


If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to
perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main
memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE
can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored
in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives 
at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the
same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?


A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245
million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets
close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?


So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,
considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or
tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and
run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives
at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years
ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.


But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you
get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have
a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI
choice really give them more performance than IDE?


True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option
is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.


No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the
best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer
eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single
hard drive system?


With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that
PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, 
is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/
partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?


So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this
really a problem?  


After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,
I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor
have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
to/from the same drive.


That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that
there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.

Obviously not.  Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long
for this to be possible.  The CGRO, is, what, 10 meters long?  You'd
need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.

What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of
the detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of the
detectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one must
model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector,
and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto
the spacecraft.  I believe they have now reduced the error to about 2
degrees.",obviously not count rate low signal rise time long possible cgro 10 meter long would need time accuracy nanosecond batse actually measure relative strength detector also function photon energy detector not isotropic response right one must model scatter photon material around detector even scatter photon earth atmosphere back onto spacecraft believe reduce error 2 degree,2,sci.space

packages.  They are based upon my experiences with an Adaptec 1542A
controller, and will, hopefully, help others.  However, note that I
cannot guarantee that the following will really help you (it works for
me), and the information in this document could possibly cause you to
lose some or all of your files on your hard disk.

***** Windows 3.1 enhanced mode:

     The Windows 3.1 install program should automatically configure DOS
and Windows for use with the Adaptec 1542.  However, just in case
something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed
to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed
that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when
you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"".


* MSDOS configuration:

     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,
you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive
(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs
much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section
called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"", for some ways of speeding your system
up.


* Windows configuration:

     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the
""[388Enh]"" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off

I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry
to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you
might want to try adding some more lines:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off
	SystemROMBreakPoint=false
	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF

(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The
""SystemROMBreakPoint"" entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).


* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:

     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that
your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's
probably because:

     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your
	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a
	winning solution.

     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to
	be seen ....

If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost
definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the
Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808
(""SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS""), you must use
Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really
slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a
factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other
solutions.

     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you
do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.
What you can do is one of the following:

     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my
	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused
	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in
	Smartdrive.

     2. Use a driver that provides ""VDS"" services (""VDS"" stands for
	""Virtual DMA Services"").  This is a standard, which is supported
	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like
	the 1542) to work with Windows.

     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following
solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I
am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused
by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following
does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:

1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI
   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two
   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your
   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   (Windows needs the ""/V386"" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into
   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies
   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be
   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's
   still there).

2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version
   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers
   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS
	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high
   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would
   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support
   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine
   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.

   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would
   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE
   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason
   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.

   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of
   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.

   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without
   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider
   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.

3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is
   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer
   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS
   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not
   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only
   three ways to get a copy:

      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver
	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other
	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is
	around $75.

      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you
	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for
	around $30.

      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0
	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is
	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two
	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy
	of ASPI4DOS 3.1.

Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with
Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing
this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above
solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the
parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various
memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no
problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers
(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems
show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case
it isn't a hardware problem.


***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:

     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a
floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory
Systems Jumbo 250:

1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive
   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.

2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.
   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.
   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so
   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
   1542.)


* Tape backups/restores take a long time:

     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may
have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 ""bus on/off timing"" for best
results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup
or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with
only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the
Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,
start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).
This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer
than necessary.

     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to
transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA
to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,
rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).
The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is
""too large"".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the
tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec ""hogs"" the memory too
much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,
because data is not fed to it quickly enough.

     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The
default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.
The ""bus on"" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can
be done in one of two ways:

* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the ""/n"" option.  For example, I use
  a ""bus on"" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the
  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:

	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4

  Note that there is NO space between the ""/n"" and the ""4"".

* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a
  program called ""SETSCSI.EXE"", which is very difficult to find.  The
  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to
  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for
  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have
  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to
  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have
  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:

	setscsi -n:4

  This adjusts the ""bus on"" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running
  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
  factory defaults.

  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use
  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I
  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.

Do not lower the ""bus on"" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it
above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4
microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little.

     Once you've lowered the ""bus on"" timing, tape backups and restores
should run faster.

     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other
options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what
you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by
starving memory refresh.

     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless
this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),
this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried
running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I
was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a
conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,
although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?


* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:

     This ""problem"" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my
system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.
However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm
mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my
1542.

     Symptoms of this ""problem"", which persists even after cleaning the
tape head:

1. Backing up to tape encounters ""unusable sector detected"" errors,
   resulting in an aborted tape backup.

2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.

3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.
   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (""Tape backups/restores take a
   long time""), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,
   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.

4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other
   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software
   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the
   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.

5. Too many tape read errors.

     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I
upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy
controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I
decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)
reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive.

     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.
On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different
controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;
however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller.


***** Sound cards:

     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and
this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the
Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the
tape DMA, this ""conflict"" usually manifests itself as a parity error
(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is
that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a
parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware.

     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,
recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).

     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the
Adaptec's ""bus on"" timing.  See the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may
not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the
speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this.


***** Miscellaneous info:

     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much
of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not
verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm
not sure.  Use it at your own risk.

* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the ""DB=""
  parameter (e.g., ""DB=2""), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.
  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install
  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of
  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a
  version earlier than 6.00).

  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the ""DB="" parameter.

* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you
  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is
  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.

* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces
  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three
  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following
  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand
  information):

     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for
	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,
	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact
	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains
	everything that you need.

     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM
	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know
	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around
	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS
	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,
	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.

     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been
	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in
	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the
	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410
	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of
	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in
	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin
	boards.

* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows
  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are
  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how
  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the
  following is secondhand information):

     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers
	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.

     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup
	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more
	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but
	requires, ASPI4DOS.

* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:

     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.
     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.
     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and
	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.

  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:

     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI
	drivers).

* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar
  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you
  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used
  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know
  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,
  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:

	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>
	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx
	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10
	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr

  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might
  have it, if any forum does.

* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are
  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.
  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and
  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work
  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of
  BSD Unix).

* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS
  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked
  like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I
  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still
  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first
  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version
  doesn't.

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the ""creative excuses"" offered the judge by others.

After listening to a number of ""Well, I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up"" versions, I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than
impressed with any of them.

This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice: ""Well son, those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for
your self?""

""Well Sir"", meekly the defenant replied, ""I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.""
He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

Isn't America Great??

you would consider ""must ride"" while on the way to Knoxville.

I can leave as early as 5/22 and need to arrive in Knoxville by 6PM

into West Va (I-77) to run up 219 -> Marlington, 28 -> Petersburg, 
55E -> I-81/I-66E.  After this point the route is presently undetermined

You'll probably get one when you realize that your $100 vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...

With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.

Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus.  It actually  slows down your system

Maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus
IDE is

Vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi? whatever intels spec is.
VLBUS it not good for much more than vga cards.

To each his own.  I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you
spent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more
space.

Here Here....



don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know
nothing about.


I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.
(obviously exaggerated).

Have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't
because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.


I guess you probably bought a 486sx too


What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap....

Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want
to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.

the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.
All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2
drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.  
IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance.
SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.

neither one is better in all cases.

If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa
busmastering cards.

     You'll find that in Allen, C.W., ""Astrophysical Quantities"", Athlone
Press, Dover, NH, 3rd edition, pp. 268-269 (1973).  To the accuracy it can
be calculated (see specific references in Allen about how it is
calculated), the temperature is 3 degrees K.

     Lots of people have remarked on this temperature.  The first may have
been in Eddington's book, ""Internal Constitution of Stars"", Ch. 13 (1926;
reprinted 1986), where he gives the ""temperature of space"" as 3 degrees.

     The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight.


     To the accuracy of measurement, it's the same temperature.  Some of us
think this may not be a coincidence.  -|Tom|-

Jonathan, interesting questions.  Some wonder whether or not the moon could
have ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what
our geology/environmental sciences friends think.

As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms
of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)
is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.
This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high
altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by
helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on
Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak
without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because
if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably
pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So
this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be
limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher
pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and
could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the
bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of
pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in
front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes
toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen
narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like

The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the
primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image
processing software that much faster. When they use the _same_ deconvolution 
software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some 
incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will 
_exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.  

Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works 
realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might be
interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in
the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the 
April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product.
It lists for $1,290.  The article states: ""The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System 
comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry 
around.""  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest
objects, ""it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter
in the telescope's focal plane.""  Now just imagine how well this infant 
technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that 
has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its
development.

"Hi,

I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software
others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone 
claims..)

Anyway..

1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900
SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine
already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found 
out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. 

But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly
little use..

2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design
of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??

3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit
) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed...
(Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)

4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM
on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... 

For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available
from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc...
What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...

I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll 
suspect not .. 

5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????
   As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls
   0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on
   entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given 
   conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to

"Yo, Whaz up!!!

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,
I saw one think that someone said about ""Show me a team that used Split-
fires....""  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires
increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing
on horsepower numbers.

Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that
depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?
In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,
but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.
So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.

But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,
but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for
the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,
twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this
translate?  Increased torque should ""theoretically"" help twins make
more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods
or anything made, just stick 'em in.

Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with
somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than
4's.        

As far as racing teams....  Ducati team ""Fast by Ferraci"" used
splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James
running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.
Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....

Peace.

Well, sounds great to me! When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me,
I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
pumping the pedal. You will, obviously need a bit of free play in your
brake pedal to do this. It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
him/her/it may mean that something is wrong.

The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light may
change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth, or the
occupant(s) may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such
physically (on you or your now-parked bike). Admittedly, the latter is a
slim chance, but it would be enough to give me pause.

  Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact
that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much
of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the
industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired
and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point
where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that
the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,
Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  ""When it's time to railroad,
you railroad.""


  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.
However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the
Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and
merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be
shared.


  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a
Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations
can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),
Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in
1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were
within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well
within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only
a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.
  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by
taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane
that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions
asked.

"Hai,

In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).
It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard.
It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.

My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I
consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:

	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2
	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)
	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
	  support (text & graphics)
	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
	- Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like
to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it.


For the people in Holland:
Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg
is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam!

Moreover, if two riders are riding together at the same speed,
one might be riding well beyond his abilities and the other
may have a safety margin left.


Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls.
On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you,
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control.

I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us, but it seems that you're blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted.

"Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their
ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,
therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,
or 75 Statute miles.

Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss
type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.
Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical 
strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant
section column.  

A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound
load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in
calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross
sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure
below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile 
below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.

The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section
to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile
of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical
limit on area, although there will be practical limits based
on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how
much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need
a foundation that the bedrock can support.

Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction
cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,
assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure
is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass
ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower
height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant
atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses
will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of
rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,
but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus
they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting
from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.

This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind
loads.  These will require more structural support over the first
15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low
enough value for it not to be a big factor.

Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC
pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley
Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've
tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain
plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal

emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced
as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING

One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, you
don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization
burn(s).  On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have an
SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means
that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has
a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.

Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not-

As an earlier post noted - through DMA.



Any one time means IMHO a single byte xfer. If I have four sources of
DMA requests ready, the DMA would service the one after the other. If
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISA/DMA
bandwidth, this will work.

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA
controller.

Well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct
some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.  They pioneered
this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA.
(Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...)


This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of.  Does anyone
know if he's involved?


This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My
guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to
build large, inflatable space structures.


If this is true, I think it's a great idea.

Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential
step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be
shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space
station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.
(Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...)
If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates
creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so
much the better.


And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild
idea"" stage or does it have real funding?


Not yet.  Though, if this project goes through, I suppose The Return
of Jeremy Rifkin is inevitable...

the name Podlipk, and is a short distance from Zvezdny Gorodok (Star

                               POST-LAUNCH
                           April 23 - 29, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were
performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43
(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.

2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the
Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).

4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was
performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of
two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.

6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.
The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately
20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18
degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back
to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The
RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.

     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,
a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on
May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the
Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test
mini-sequence.

7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees
from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,
back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of
the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was
at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4
degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN
(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 203 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took
place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was
successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with
DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).

2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development
Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current
Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported.

Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to 
purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be
one of the following:
a) An employee of a government agency.
b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.
c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in
research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: 
The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.
Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction
and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.

The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any 
organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions 
to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:
- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the
location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. 
- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft
within the operating radius around the launch site.
- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.
- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that
unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.

Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)
are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the
western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular
since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).

The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'
use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is
from 50 to 500 or more feet. 

By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from
most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart
C, for details.

As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to
50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical
rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,
or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry
either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches
in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.

Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.


Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets
for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything
bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to
practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs
takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.


That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE
ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest
misconceptions people have about our hobby. 

True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get

Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.

Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?

If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  
As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more 
than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in 
the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is 
at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker?  

Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the 
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape.

If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either
the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head
assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may
need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor
is out. 

If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for
repair.

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the
prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort.  You can
spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches.

What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on
investment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and
the prize is just the icing on the cake.

I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough
return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current
US launchers.  (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules
for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.)
You're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch
system rather than pissing it away on existing ones.  Being there first is
of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it.

"For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution
     Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits:

I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which

multispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16
sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit
I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC
(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight
answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).

Other questions:

- Excuse my ignorance, but is ""Texel"" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM
  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?

- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the

Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my
uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,

   The whole question of ""a right to a dark sky"" revolves around the
definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and
good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone
representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or
the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and
then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution
provides a ""Bill of Rights"" from which most if not all legal rights are
considered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have
comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right
to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the
U.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To
keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law

"Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For
example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe""
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  

For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments
""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e.
as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging
congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky
scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  

I've heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled""
spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believe
that this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode.
This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the
spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a
(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.
At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can
continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to
the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the
spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be
prepared if necessary.  

As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is
beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,
great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.
By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps
someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the
data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.

I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which
could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to
places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,
exiting the solar system, etc).   

Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,
etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case their
spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of
the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could
have some kind of routine written in for the post mission
""drift"" phase.

So any holes in all this?

Has anybody every come across a problem whereby a hard disk locks up (ie. crashes the system) when attempting to load disk caching?

I think the logic board may have been buggered, but the drive works PERFECTLY without a disk cache.

I tried HyperDisk and various versions of SmartDRIVE, all to no avail.

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated .. I need a cached drive, but I need the extra space of my second drive just as much! :-)

Thanks.

a Pantah based V-twin) was the 500SL Pantah, and it ran a creditable 13.0 @

BTW, FZR 400s ran mid 12s, and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that.  It's hard to remember, but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old

SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software
Engineering Institute).  I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating
only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was
*not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather
through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the
Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and
did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning'
status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if
anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of
the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).

Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with
control of the software process; the assumption is that a
well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind
that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is
produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if
that).

Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.
To do this, you have to push against something, and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,
the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the 
ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground 
pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  
The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing 
problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which
had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), 
but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel 
toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the 
wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter-

     What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble.  For
providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.
Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket
Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to
lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --
and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for
our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.

     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a
torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new
thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things
from past masters.

     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called
experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no
sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of
the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,
""defies the best principles of launching payloads into space."" 
Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these
principles that SSRT defies?

     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need
a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the
""fact"" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it
violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for
less than many billions of dollars.

     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us
some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a
Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to
demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.

     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind
us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a
senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,
cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a
single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. 
Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a
little, Test a little.

     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We
didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change
every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The
ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better
known as ""Shape Shifter"" than ""Space Lifter.""  We didn't spend a
lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the
last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't
take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in
18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of
one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the
threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if
it ran over cost or schedule.

     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its
only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps
that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But
each step should follow the same principles -- a small management
team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest
budget.

     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:
(See charts)

     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's
and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that
can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we
could do is soft-land on Earth!

     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a
little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable
and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among
you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal
protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land
horizontally, etc, etc.

     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You
bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do
what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not
included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your
program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and
decade long programs.]",speech pete worden deliver we space foundation conference colorado spring colorado april 15 1993 delightful opportunity cause trouble provide forum would sincerely like thank we space foundation topic today single stage rocket technology rocket ssrt intend speak low cost make rapid progress ssrt mind hope convince erupt new rallying cry generation space fast cheaper well fast cheap well ssrt represent pass torch one technical generation another new thing sure also relearn old thing past master roll ssrt baby two week ago call expert tell we violate law physic make sense example dr eberhart rachtin former president aerospace corp say ssrt la time defy good principle launch payload space well dr rachtin make we mad principle ssrt defy well tell violate principle need giant program office build space hardware violate fact take 20 year build something new violate truism ca nt anything significant less many billion dollar take last generation expert teach we newold lesson werhner von braun first rocket not saturn v general schriever icbm not take ten year demonstrate x1 airplane not cost 1 billion take one great engineer 1950 remind we truth max hunter max remind senior engineer thor irbm program old fast well cheap success story max persistent vision single stage reusable space launch system since 1960 knew do affordable step build little test little next persuade we technology demonstration not solicit bunch requirement would change every year anyway not include speech alsnls ephemeral requirement would well know shape shifter space lifter not spend lot money xrocket cost 60 million last time even build new airplane not take lot time build mcdonnell dougla complete 18 month finally government program office consist one overworked air force major motivated part threat would get ride strappedon lawn chair run cost schedule describe ssrt not keep mind first step several step step easily fail we field ssto step follow principle small management team year technology demonstration modest budget let show detail ssrt might evolve see chart embarrassed generation compare last generation giant last great space era 1950 1960 go moon build telescope not see straight softlande mar least could softland earth answer follow build little test little philosophy produce truly affordable routine access space know nay sayer among say ssrt stunt need thermal protection engine wrong would well land horizontally etc etc say see white sand june bring viewgraph bring rocketship say let we next step not include speech fail still program office staff summary sheet requirement analyse decade long program,2,sci.space

"Hello all,

You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)
This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with
serials/paral/floppies and 
	- IDE controller ""clone"" Gw2760-EX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 
	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3"" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages
		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.
		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,
		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)

Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected.

Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.
Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount
the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.

I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,
or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, 
depending on setup/jumpers.

Useful suggestions might be:
- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- Do I need some driver to make it work?
- --- "" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?
- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE
is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change
a chip or put a jumper!

Also useful:
- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.
- ftp archives with relevant info.
- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
- any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )

Direct or posted replies are ok.

"Idea for repair of satellites:

Warning I am getting creative again:

Why not build a inflatable space dock.

Basically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure,
saw it on beyond 2000), then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then
move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it..
The inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to
be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat),
thenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite
to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped

Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and
non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much
of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.
The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and
even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL
charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA
commercialization centers; they charge a fee.

Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack
experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand
the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack
of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't
a flame, jsut a statement.

Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.



Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in
their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
change depending on the customer.


Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.


Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When
WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where
doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the
only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
problems and building a station.


When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that
integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part
of a successful large scale effort.


The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on
Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers
you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address
the problems until the press published the story.

Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address
the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?


You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for
resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying
is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.


I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might ""cook the
focal elements"", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem is
that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight,
lest like Icarus' wings it melt.  (I think it was glues and such, as well
as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain
furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small
sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA.
(A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)",hga not reflective wavelength might cook focal element figure good scalesthe problem antenna could not expose venuslevel sunlight lest like icarus wing melt think glue well electronic worry thus remain furl axis always point near sun small sunshade tip antenna mast would shadow fold hga large sunshade beneath antenna shield spacecraft bus,2,sci.space

This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior
to us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced
and therefore ""more intelegent"" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there
is life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have
no clue as to weather they are ""intelegent"" or not.


That's a good point, I hadn't thought of it that way.  My question however was
more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars
and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign
countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night.
Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved
these issues on our own?


But... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided
that certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior
to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no
homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and
more.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm
the land and go to church on sunday?

A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable
locks under the Kryptonite name.

When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite 
U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for
a new lock for the bicycle.

For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock
(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,
Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).
I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in
disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.

First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by
the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of
quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable
lock with the Kryptonite name on it.

Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I
don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often
quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes
it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.

Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves
the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the 
dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the 
lock mechanism would stand up to an ""insert screwdriver and TORQUE""
attack.

Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to 
deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the
weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient
you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go 
through the cable in well under a minute.

"In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine
without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor
on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with
either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing
power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.
This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz
machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.
note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if
you are running Windows.
Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you
were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed
of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even
if your original processor runs at a slower speed.
There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX
on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX
or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,
then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and
replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for
both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip
costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the
25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math
coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the
Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a
20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally
and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is
rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.

You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that
advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop
around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for
a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.

"Howdy,

Sorry if this has been covered before:

One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his
NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said ""No problem"" and went to work.
Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during 
installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit 
Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted 
with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition 
was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a
32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried 
to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am 
unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I 
kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS 
installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for 
""Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC"")...

Do you know of the world-wide-web?  This is a global hypertext (well, 
hypermedia) network running on the internet.  One of the nice things
about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the
other systems being used, like WAIS, Gopher, FTP, Archie, etc.  It
is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web.

If you'd like to explore, I'd suggest getting the XMosaic program,
written at the NCSA.  It's an X-windows web browser, and is pretty
slick.  It can understand and cope with more than text: gif, jpeg, mpeg,
audio, etc.  There are other browsers, including a text-mode browser
for people stuck on a text terminal, but I'm most familliar with mosaic.

Under the page ""The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Subject Catalogue""
(this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic, or by any
browser via the URL 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html )
there is a subject ""Space Science.""  Currently this points to a
page under construction, with only the NASA JPL FTP archive.  I've
volunteered to take over this page, and in fact I have a replacement
with all sorts of information pointers (mostly gleaned from the
sci.space FAQ).  As soon as the overworked ""Subject Catalogue"" 
maintainer switches the ""Space Science"" pointer, it'll be visible.

I'll post a short note when this happens.

     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.
  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD

   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-
inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.
Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.

   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David
Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.

   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space
Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the
National Space Society, which is an international non-profit
organization that promotes development of the space frontier.
The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me. and the commercial/

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really
stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But
DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as 
motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,
but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,
admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.",hey man bring agree completely drive drunk really stupid understand appreciate feel bad dwi endemic society real problem motorcyclist worst vulnerable position around drunk driver alert reader might remember last year witness dwi accident right bloody front unable save life one participant report also drunk driving motorcyclist prime cause injury death raise insurance rate force stupidly restrictive law turn public we ride responsibly view drunk driving carry mandatory prison sentence one traffic offense not public fund issue genuine safety issue bring subject recmoto admitting catch dwi look sympathy consequence not expect people respond warm wish,1,rec.motorcycles

OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it.

"Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...
  
   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried
out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some
time.  A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion
Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-
0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper
describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve
aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems
associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed
airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane
   The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the
paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000
pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and
life support.  System design reliability is .9995.
   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets
and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-
long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-
stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy
payload on an expendable second stage.
   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a
normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,
modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,
would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing
out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like
aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.
   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff
is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.
The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs
of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust
rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,
with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-
25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would
be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's
success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact
tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.
     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude
while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,
cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater
safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle
and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major
use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-
ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide
as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical
configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can
be shown to be operationally viable.""
  
   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for
some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL
SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-
examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.
   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going
studies trying straighten out the government's future space
transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)
are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are
various factions and options vying for attention -- including
shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3""
architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced
vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,
etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy
for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to
juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against
medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against
the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies
like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.
   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't
that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens
of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in
the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a
final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.

I am sure your numbers are far better then mine.  As i said above,
i don't have exact numbers.


How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug
be from that of the Shuttle and it's OMS engines??????

I know that no small manuevering tug exists,  but maybe  one could
soup up a Bus 1.   Does anyone out there have the de-clasified
specs on hte BUS 1?  would it be able to provide enough  control
force to balance the HST,  and  still have the rocket thrust
to hurl her into a decent high orbit?


Sorry,  that should be intrument pointing.


Plus, if the second box gets fritzy, you could be in shitter ville

The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the mission
was planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was
enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THey
have now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve
EVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere.
My guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   

I just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper
better,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable

I'd hardly call the current Pluto Fast Flyby proposal ""too large"" (if the
new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds, the S/C mass will
drop to 110-120 kg) or ""too expensive"" ($400 million [FY92 $] for two S/C),
especially when compared to other NASA planetary missions.


This proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and
the require minimal delta-v from the mother ship.  A mission to the main belt
might be one possibility for such a mission -- I recall a paper being presented
at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed
spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin (I think).  Four
mini-spacecraft would detatch from the main S/C, each visiting a seperate
asteroid and then returning to the main S/C.  After analysis, the main S/C
would then be targeted for the most ""interesting"" object for further study.

Now, if I could only *find* that paper...  =)

Well, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks,
or to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic.
Now I just try to get them off my tail.

In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in
front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the 
jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch
into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a
better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than
from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.

In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass,
I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name,
(still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.  

If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps 
(for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get
my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  

A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for
me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,
yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a
cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. 

On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last
vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk
waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing
illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.

Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong 
as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurt
found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't
used their brakes at all prior to impact.  

I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in 
a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you
ever use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to do
any turning.  If you follow me down a long straight, and I seem to be 
wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's because
I'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in
my path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile, but if I have even
milliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully 
the most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to braking
with the front brake, of course.",apparently instinct brake face danger not strong instinct freeze nothing face danger hurt find surprising number accidentinvolve motorcyclist not use brake prior impact think way ever use countersteere reliably correctly crisis make conscious method directional control ever use practice constantly even need turn follow long straight seem wiggle back forth randomly suddenly without obvious need practice countersteere avoid imaginary obstacle directly path practice may indeed futile even millisecond react familiar tactic available hopefully automatic countersteere logic apply brake front brake course,1,rec.motorcycles

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with
the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.
Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time
of arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often
get positions down to ~arc minutes.

BTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the
fairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1
ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a
distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing
and t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try 
replacing the battery.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor 
charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.",likely reason backup battery fail battery maintain content cmos memory ac power turn battery flakey content cmos lose checksum wrong along cmos datum try replace battery however pc not use battery large capacitor power cmos check see replace capacitor normal lithium battery not possible make sure leave pc half hour hour day keep capacitor charge would opt battery change though,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this
little problem.  I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that
we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  
This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here.
        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration
of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,
its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several
different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the
galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a
R=8800Mpc.  
        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the
old standby formula:
                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak
        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty
energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.
And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call
moderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that
much energy in one second?

Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are
completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).



Great, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the
way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.


I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs
if they are really interested in this stuff.



Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like ""SCSI-2 compliant"" which tells
you nothing about the performance, whether it has ""WIDE"" support, etc.

"FOR SALE:

AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem

The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer
than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,
v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so
you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone
line.  They will ""fall back"" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even
disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems.

It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with
multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).

They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible.

These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.

They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the
NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows
application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,
as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).

I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or
below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an
equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is
backed by a company that will never go away.

This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of
downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home
to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal
modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation.)

If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem
at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for
about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.

If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at 
(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.

I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.
My 2 cents worth:

The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. 
A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference
which way you attach.

Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo
to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think
the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire
connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two
wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate
two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.

LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which
way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,
if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the
board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard
is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't
light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.

If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.

Hope this helps.",put replace motherboard system similar question 2 cent worth speaker connector two wire go speaker speaker coil bidirectional make difference way attach turbo switch three wire control want turbo become active switch push switch think middle wire common use ohm meter figure wire connect common wire switch push two wire connect switch place appropriate two wire turbo berg connector motherboard lead turbo hd lead uni directional depend way wire attach lead not light ami motherboard turbo switch wire not attach berg connector board board power default turbo mode motherboard like attace lead wire board lead not light power reverse connector try work attach turbo switch board hope help,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when
its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo
motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few
days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --
the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.

It's not true.  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing
doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.  My VL-IDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3MB/sec up to 8.3MB/
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
*milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3MB/sec on the ISA bus.

I am familiar with the project.  It is the Onboard Shuttle Flight
Software Project.  This software controls the Space Shuttle During
all dynamic phases as well as on-orbit.
It has ultra-high reliability and extremely
low error rates.  There have been several papers published on the
subject and I'll collect some references.  There may be an
article in the IBM Systems Journal Late '93, early '94.

There is no magic formula.  We did it with dedicated and disciplined
folks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors
and is corrected based on errors that ""escape"".  We present a
one day overview of our process periodically to interested folks.
The next one is May 19th in Washington, D.C.  I can fax specifics

This was all badly reported in the news.  There is no evidence that
signs of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizing
events.  Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the last
sterilizing event, then it must be easily formed.  The *inference*
was that life originated before and was destroyed, but there was
no evidence of that.

However, even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin of
life requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of the
atmosphere) that do not last for long.  So, perhaps life formed
early only because it would have had no other chance to do so,
not because it was likely that life would originate under those
conditions.",badly report news evidence sign life find old rock predate putative planetsterilizing event rather argument life arise shortly last sterilize event must easily form inference life originated destroy evidence however even argument flawed could well origin life require specific condition say certain composition atmosphere not last long perhaps life form early would chance not likely life would originate condition,2,sci.space

Obcountersteer:  For some reason, I've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For
example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned

I need psychological help.

Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all,
so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was
an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten
during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion
into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes
a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.

Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When
graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,
presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the
area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes
'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)
envelope'. 

Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually
flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are
are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots
do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the
correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in
essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is
done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally
carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how
far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,
such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed
taxi tests).

I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about
this process (and then some).

please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list!

there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list, that it
be about BMW's. I don't care which BMW, any and all are welcome. I will
probably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter, and
would incourage other club members to do the same, especially tech
articles.

to subscribe to the list, send a message to the list address:

                    bmw@rider.cactus.org

with the word SUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having
the word SUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to subscribe. if you 
put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone
on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief.

       ** your From: line must have a valid return address    **
       ** the list sw will use the address in your From: line **

if you would like to use a return address _other_ than what is contained
in your From: line, do not send mail to the list! send a note directly to
me (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll take care of it manually.

the list sw will hack up the outgoing message From: line so that your
original full name in ()'s is preserved, but the return address is
replaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this 
allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending
on your mail interface natch. I use elm so that's what I wrote it for :-).
keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors
parentage.

to remove your name from the list, send a message to the list address
with the word UNSUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message.
having the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to remove
your name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body, 
your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed

the list is run from my home system, a poor little 286 box running a
very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the MTA
isn't the smartest around, but I've managed to hack it up enough to make
a decent list MTA. additions and removals are handled automatically by
scripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and
may occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you
subscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount
of time (my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts), send me a 
message (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll look into it.

if the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number
of addresses, I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up
with a better MTA.

In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a
project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in
hassles.

The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to
the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically
down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any
new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --
the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,
you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns
and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.

The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for
more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.
For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop
a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper
might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less
ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing
sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
money in a big way.

Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a
minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which
dominates the cost of the project.",fact probably want avoid we government anything project pricetag invariably high either money hassle important thing realize big cost get moon get low earth orbit everything else practically noise part get moon pose new problem beyond face low orbit last 10 km actual landing not immensely difficult course spend sagadollar saga metric prefix beelyun beelyun thing launch not major component realistic plan go moon cheaply brief visit least lowcost transport earth orbit cost launch one shuttle two titan ivs develop new launch system considerably cheap delta clipper might bit expensive perhaps less ambitious way bring cost quite bit plan sustain lunar exploration use exist launch system waste money big way give question like whose launch facility use not minor detail important cost launch dominate cost project,2,sci.space

This is not quite right.  The differential arrival time techinique
requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions.  The
differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 10's of nanoseconds.
This is smaller than BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities.
BATSE, Ulysses, and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique.

Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view.
The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing 
angle of incidence.  The burst position on the sky is determined by

The balloons were in sufficiently low orbit that they experienced
some air resistance.  When they were finally punctured, this

a spherical shape against this resistance) caused them to

Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a
couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750
GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that
most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-
order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily
by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep 
them honest about acquiring parts. 

For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a
HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.
Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are
not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the 
plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,
then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it
on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,
more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.

It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call
some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than
you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)

For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get
both feet on the ground when you stop.
 
The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety
Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion
of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you
to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment.  Ran forward,
it would suck energy from the Earth's magnetic field, while trivially
slowing the Shuttle.  It could also have run backward -- if they ran 
electricity through the tether the other way, it would have trivially
propelled the Shuttle faster.

But an even better example comes to mind.  There's this electronics guy,
someone like Craig Anderton or Don Lancaster.  Ten years ago he wrote about
an invention of his.  He could take a light-detector, run current through
it at about a hundred times its rating, and it would glow.  He got legal
rights to this design of a combination ""fiber optic emitter/receiver"".  This
turned out to be the basic unit of ATT's  (I think) plan to bring Brazil's

    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?
    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time
    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time
    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.

4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE

NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
April 6, 1993

RELEASE:  93-64

        Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology
Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the
Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance
to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space
station.

        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a
high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each
option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,
operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research
operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.

        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA
budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,
station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting
reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station
option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA
budget over the next 5 years.

        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon
administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory
committee to consider.

        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have
decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of
Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.

        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the
redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign
team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR
and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.
The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.
Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
that goal.

        Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the
redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program
represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well
managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should
be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""

        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science
Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald
Sagdeev.",blindcarboncopy spacenewsaustenrandorg ctiaustenrandorg subject white house outline option station russian cooperation date tue 06 apr 93 160021 pdt richard buenneke buennekeaustenrandorg 40693 gibbon outline space station redesign guidance nasa headquarters washington dc april 6 1993 release 9364 dr john h gibbon director office science technology policy outline membersdesignate advisory committee redesign space station april 3 three budget option guidance committee deliberation redesign space station low option 5 billion midrange option 7 billion high option 9 billion consider committee option would cover total expenditure space station fiscal year 1994 1998 would include fund development operation utilization shuttle integration facility research operation support transition cost also must include adequate program reserve insure program implementation within available fund next 5 year 4 billion reserve within nasa budget president new technology investment result station option 7 billion must accompany offset reduction rest nasa budget example space station option 9 billion would require 2 billion offset nasa budget next 5 year gibbon present information organizational session advisory committee generally membersdesignate focus upon administrative topic use session get acquaint also receive legal ethic briefing orientation process station redesign team follow develop option advisory committee consider gibbon also announce united state international partner european japanese canadian decide consultation give full consideration use russian asset course space station redesign process end russian ask participate redesign effort asneede consult basis redesign team make use expertise assess capability mir possible use mir russian capability system we international partner hope benefit expertise russian participant assess russian system technology overall goal redesign effort develop option reduce station cost preserve key research exploration capabilitiae careful integration russian asset could key factor achieve goal gibbon reiterate president clinton commit redesign space station make every effort preserve science technology job space station program represent however also commit space station well manage one not consume national resource use invest future industry nation nasa administrator daniel goldin say russian participation accomplish eastw space science center university maryland leadership roald sagdeev,2,sci.space

Andrew, yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you are 
considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice 
size external cache!  The performance is far greater.

The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX 
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither 
systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is 
still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).

Supernovae put out 10^53 or 10^54 (i forget which, but it's only an
order of magnitude...).  Not in gamma rays, though.  You'd hafta get
all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction
of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic 
(but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think
of how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up.

Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  That's just
in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but ""bursts""?
Nah.

Neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show
that those energies *are* produced by things we know about.

These questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points, but, I will
provide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice.

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board
video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and
you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of
them with 17"" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and
either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.

Do not buy a 486SX sytem.

My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When
you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they
get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large
steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX
models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.",hi change 286 soon read something ibm ps valuepoint anyone one video card really 24 bit card much cost we last question ps value point 486 sx 25mhz upgrade 486 dx2 66mhz thank veeery much advance alejandro cifuente h acifuentislugapuccl question answer dealer ibm value point provide unsolicited advice amusing kind advice today tueday 4693 ibm suppose officially announce introduction vesa local bus value point system system still onboard video disk far well prior value point system get vesa local bus future upgrade go buy three 17 monitor also newly available one three immediately upgrade ultrastor 34f cache scsi disk controller either ati gup viper graphic board not buy 486sx sytem personal philosophy upgrade policy not lossfree earn money pay taxis spend money pay taxis ie get come go translate mean take infrequent large step far well short term long term avoid sx model go straight dx dx2 model,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

I did this.  I use a relay (Radio Shack 4PDT) instead of a huge
switch.  This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work.

It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the

"   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..
   Why not??

Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where
it is, which means you either nail it to something that doesn't move
or you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on a
deactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far away
from it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on
board.

Sure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They're listed in the sci.space
Frequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt.

    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail
    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend
    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the
    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth
    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics
    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. Contributing Associate,
    minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert
Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),
and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something
to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as
quite a few references.


Check the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society*:

V36 p. 201-209 (1983)
V36 p. 483-489 (1983)

reprints? I just found the file.)

"Pennicillin if i have everything correct,  was a highly valuable
Myco-toxin,  discovered during WW2.  It proved to have an amazing
Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It's immediate
administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving
problems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially
enormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years,
the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude,
and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then
aspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide
class of infections.

Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised
amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease.
It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and
developement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times
of administration  and costs $2,000 per administration
with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost.
The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is
implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some
patients.

"A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland
    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous
    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part
    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They
    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became
    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle
    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby
    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
    visible till morning sunrise.

    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in
    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was
    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.
    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a
    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about
    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the
    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop
    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright
    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still
    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.

    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if
    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near
    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969
    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of
    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium
    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we
    have observed 17 satellite launches.

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to
answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What these
people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.

It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful object
oriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on
both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming
approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software
development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is
not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis 
capability.

Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great
idea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on
the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation
studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There
are tons of applications, with the ability to create ""virtual"" instruments
that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the
addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station,
allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial
I/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control software
for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.",know kinda subject scispace not really want answer well everyone else information people propose large already exist purchase today call labview national instrument wonderful object orient graphical programming language implement mac pc vme unix box fare superior programming approach ever see allow we decrease software development time shuttle payload 90 percent program not dependendant specific hardware already exensive analysis capability reinvent wheel platform may not exist great idea look available today hydrogen leak shuttle find use software ssme control simulation study along real testing msfc handle labview ton application ability create virtual instrument accomplish specific custom task maker desire addition ieee488 support computer become virtual control station allow graphic representation remote instrumentation serial io support instrument anywhere ground control software main control sedsat 1 utilize approach,2,sci.space

I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more
easily made'.  Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current
government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were
in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure',
since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The
market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood
forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about
taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking.
It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more
about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably
happens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.



Wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?

Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to   
invest in newer launch systems. I don't think a big cost advantage
for using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years). 
Lockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy 
the Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia). 
They should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven't heard them
propose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it 
unprofitable. 


Yes...


Comparable to the Zenit I suppose, but since it looks like
nothing will be built there, you might just as well pick any
spot.

The message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and
Kazakstan are still cooperating. Later, the story may be different.",seem like lot trouble go probably well invest new launch system not think big cost advantage use russian system last long maybe year lockheed would place ask since would probably buy proton market proton world wide except russia know lot possibility not hear propose we launch assume looked find unprofitable yes comparable zenit suppose since look like nothing build might well pick spot message launch cheap russia kazakstan still cooperate late story may different,2,sci.space

Rationale
---------
The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for
the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora
for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither
of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the
general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and
network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted 
to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,
and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.
 
The reason for the division into three groups is a natural
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics,
and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext
and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, 
Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. 
Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly
hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and
other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in
the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other
nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom
publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as
index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom
simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging
software, data capture software, data clean up, compression,
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and
video.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that
relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that
the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will
eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.
 
Notes
-----
These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.
Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general
topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms
mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.

Is it right??? That is new stuff for me. So it means that  you just can 
not put a sattellite around around the Moon for too long because its 
orbit will be unstable??? If so, what is the reason??? Is that because 
the combined gravitacional atraction of the Sun,Moon and Earth 
that does not provide a stable  orbit around the Moon???

A big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried 
to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. He kicked the dog a 
couple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog
angrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started

pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of
the pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell)
and he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. 

My second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I wasn't paying 
very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the
carcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I 
just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely over
the dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4
lumber. The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going. After
I got to my destination, I found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to

Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is
reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel
port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an
interrupt.

On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,
a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which
normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight
with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem
was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon
as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after
several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.",not completly true class late machine irq5 reserve lpt2 since rare second parallel port pc usually good safe choice need interrupt hand run problem work gateway computer 4dx33v modem com1 mouse com2 serial port set com3 normally use interrupt com1 real fight board try use irq5 discoverd problem gateway set com3 use irq5 soon disable com3 problem go away grumble several day try figure interrupt not work,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

   essential that the client software is completely pain-free.

   something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (There are only about

I just tried a few experiments. I cat'd a 20261-byte file (471 lines)
under various scenarios:

PC-Xview for DOS in a full-screen OS/2 window (1024x768x16):    18 sec
Telix (DOS) in an OS/2 window (1024xs768x256):                  107 sec!
Telix (DOS) is a full-screen OS/2 window (standard VGA):        11 sec

UW/WIN in Windows 3.1 (1024x768x256):           faster, but gave up after 2 min
UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window using pg       30 sec, could have been a

I was using an ATI Wonder XL video card, by the way.

So PC-Xview for DOS looks pretty good (and the line-by-line scrolling
in OS/2 desktop looks pathetic, although full-page redraws are pretty
good).

I tried it under PC-Xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font,
and with a very small font, and there was no difference in the times.

"Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]
  
    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the
Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:
  
SPACE ADVERTISING
    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very
common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the
space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the
(very prominent) logos on its side of
   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)
   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)
   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and
   - the GPS/Navstar program office
   This has not been considered ""paid advertising"" but rather
""public relations"", since the restrictions have been such that only
organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the
side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting
a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras
is ""advertising"" as much as it is ""public relations"", in my
opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has
rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]
   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials
for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large
advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of
several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at
putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload
bay.  These ventures would be different than ""public relations"", in
that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms
participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for
the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For
example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a
Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras
would scan past it.)
  
ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES
   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about
1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed
to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe
company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,
Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last
Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from
participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for
example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the
British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.
   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch
vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET
recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements
on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie ""The Last
Action Hero"".  Besides the usual logos of the participating
organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the
main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster
rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for
one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in
Space News magazine a couple of months ago.
   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is
talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he
created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising
sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the
space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on
the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it ""would not use
his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and
receiving compensation.""   This is being disputed, since the launch
is a ""commercial launch"" and NASA is receiving none of the
advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is
coming from NASA.)
  
ORBITAL ""BILLBOARDS""
   Orbital ""billboards"" have been the staple of science fiction for
some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert
Heinlein described another in ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"".  Several
different potential projects have been developed, although none have
been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the ""Eiffel
II"" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in
orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

A short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention
about how the Japanese, using what sounded like a gravity assist, had just
managed to crash (or crash-land) a package on the moon.

the article was very vague and unclear.  and, to make matters worse, I
didn't clip it.

does this jog anyone's memory?

SPACE ACTIVIST/INTEREST/RESEARCH GROUPS AND SPACE PUBLICATIONS

    GROUPS

    AIA -- Aerospace Industry Association. Professional group, with primary
	membership of major aerospace firms. Headquartered in the DC area.
	Acts as the ""voice of the aerospace industry"" -- and it's opinions
	are usually backed up by reams of analyses and the reputations of
	the firms in AIA.

	    [address needed]

    AIAA -- American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
	Professional association, with somewhere about 30,000-40,000
	members. 65 local chapters around the country -- largest chapters
	are DC area (3000 members), LA (2100 members), San Francisco (2000
	members), Seattle/NW (1500), Houston (1200) and Orange County
	(1200), plus student chapters. Not a union, but acts to represent
	aviation and space professionals (engineers, managers, financial
	types) nationwide. Holds over 30 conferences a year on space and
	aviation topics publishes technical Journals (Aerospace Journal,
	Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, etc.), technical reference books
	and is _THE_ source on current aerospace state of the art through
	their published papers and proceedings. Also offers continuing
	education classes on aerospace design. Has over 60 technical
	committees, and over 30 committees for industry standards. AIAA acts
	as a professional society -- offers a centralized resume/jobs
	function, provides classes on job search, offers low-cost health and
	life insurance, and lobbies for appropriate legislation (AIAA was
	one of the major organizations pushing for IRAs - Individual
	Retirement Accounts). Very active public policy arm -- works
	directly with the media, congress and government agencies as a
	legislative liaison and clearinghouse for inquiries about aerospace
	technology technical issues. Reasonably non-partisan, in that they
	represent the industry as a whole, and not a single company,
	organization, or viewpoint.

Continuously, on this forum, and on the street, you find quite a difference
between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals.
Cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
(what they like and dislike about motorcycling). This is not closed-minded. 
To NOT RECOGNIZE this, is in effect, close-minded.


I scan it for information, a lot of it is NOISE and pointless flame-age.
(it's why I used trn, instead of rn)

If you have a problem with that, I'm really sorry for you..

"Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about
3 minutes to warm up.  

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the 
CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait 
for about 3min before the display shows anything and
it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens
when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).
If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
again, the display works as normal like before.

Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that
it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a
386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for
years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.

I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer.
Thanks a lot.

Edwin

This is not good advice.  A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed
getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)
hit the pavement with a ""clunk"", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the
paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the
helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a
fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.
This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a
wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam
liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.
They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination
of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or
outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they
would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet
with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would
compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.
(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim
prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)

The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity
can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure
is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet
manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point
to consider when purchasing a lid.

 ========================================================================
A couple of points on this thread.

1. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger
   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.

2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is
   not dependent on ""sophisticated tools""  (CASE tools?).  However, tools
   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle
   Language) is somewhat limited.

3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated ""Level 5"" by a NASA team.
   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.

4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info
   on our software development process.

"Hi,
    I was reading through ""The Spaceflight Handbook"" and somewhere in
there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them
when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to
the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he
estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not
be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published
in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very
long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?
Can this be extended to larger accelerations?",hi read spaceflight handbook somewhere author discuss solar sail force act try gain initial acceleration pass close sun hyperbolic orbit magnitude acceleration estimate order 700 g also say may not big problem man craft human publish 1986 already withstood acceleration 45 g longwinded question finally 45 g acceleration fact humanly tolerable aid mechanical device course possible use absorb acceleration extend large acceleration,2,sci.space
"I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

"People who criticize ""big Government"" and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
long-term.  

(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to
compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)

As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve
itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should
drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But
the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or
some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So
the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a
lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,
doesn't it?)

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to
cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new
technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,
despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly
earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in
new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little
sense to try to save money.

Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY
disagrees about that the wisdom should be.  

It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects.
GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry
has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large
construction project now uses these tools.

Actually, the iAPX86 family has a HALT instruction that causes the CPU to
cease processing instructions.  The CPU resumes processing either by being
reset or by receiving an external (hardware) interrupt.  This is different
from the power management facilities Victor mentions.  Of course, whether an
operating system's idle loop uses the HALT instruction is another matter
entirely.

"I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans.
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet.  The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions.

eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist
     from the sun and the suns temperature..)
   Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance
   Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much
     can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect
     atmosphere.  I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the
     earth.  I suppose density should be important as well.

Climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc.  Just the above
three factors and how they relate to one another.

    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS

    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints
    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on
    microfilm.

    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it
    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like
    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB
    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch
    from.

    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify
    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean
    sheet design.


    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE

    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access
    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an
    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being
    ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently
    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early
    in a mission.


    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES

    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to
    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium
    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in
    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental
    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.
    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2
    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather
    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months
    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar
    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which
    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in
    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are
    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10
    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

    IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER

    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from
    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible
    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies
    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in
    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The
    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted
    study, Charles Jackman.

    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the
    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was
    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space
    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia
    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space
    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and
    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects
    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.

    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:

       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year
	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year
	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year

    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are
    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the
    total stratospheric chlorine sources.

    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would
    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability
    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.

    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed
    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally
    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and
    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch
    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be
    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about
    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons
    do at the present time.

    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space
    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR
    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical

    HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE

    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a
    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your
    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to
    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your
    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal
    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no
    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do
    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.

    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some
    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)
    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from
    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,
    you're dying. The limits are not really known.

    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED

    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is
    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.
    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank
    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the
    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin
    team's medical/forensic report.

    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the
    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks
    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team
    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.


    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT

    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit
    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry
    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.

    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of
    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in
    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly
    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it
    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would
    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit
    spacecraft.

    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]


    THE ""FACE ON MARS""

    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid
    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:
    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often
    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13
    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).

    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is
    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an
    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the
    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a
    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere
    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't
    know the address) to study the Face.

    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution
    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this
    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is
    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or
    sci.astro.

As Ben says - this re-boost idea is all news to us here.  Do you know 
something we don't?  Please supply a source - it would be nice for 
the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to 
be.  These altitude numbers are also way off.  

My best source has: 
""Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    573 Kilometers""
""Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    603 Kilometers""
""Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:      3 Kilometers"" 

(PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base - used to schedule observations.) 
..


Could you supply some calculations?  You might check some recent 
postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does 
not now exist, so comparing the mass of something that doesn't 
exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible.  The contamination 
threat also remains.  

.. 
  Longer drag life I can understand, but could you explain the 
antenna pointing?  


Tell me about it.  Although the arrays can be (and are) moved perfectly 
well utilizing the second electronics box.  Getting them both working 
is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy.

CONTACTING NASA, ESA, AND OTHER SPACE AGENCIES/COMPANIES

Many space activities center around large Government or International
Bureaucracies.	In the US that means NASA.  If you have basic information
requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and
ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1),
etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.

EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by
investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a
multiple of 10,000 letters a day. Seek the Public Information Office at one
of the below, this is their job:

NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the
civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government.
It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet
post such as the military Department of Defense.  Its 20K+ employees
are civil servants and hence US citizens.  Another 100K+ contractors
also work for NASA.

	Magellan, Galileo, and will run Cassini, CRAF, etc. etc.. For
	images, probe navigation, and other info about unmanned exploration,
	this is the place to go.

	JPL is run under contract for NASA by the nearby California
	Institute of Technology, unlike the NASA centers above. This
	distinction is subtle but critical. JPL has different requirements
	for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires. For instance in
	the latter, an SF 171 is useless. Employees are Caltech employees,
	contractors, and for the most part have similar responsibilities.

had to send the women to a lower altitude when they were pregnant in order

Another factor you should consider is the X-ray opacity of the atmosphere

"We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern
postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll
get round to it eventually.

The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,
with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke
the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap
forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with
primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean
going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo
and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose
with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles
without coaling.

Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,
and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster
said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable
laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying
a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to
carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for
defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book ""How the World was One""
[ I think that`s right ]

If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph
and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely
ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true the
Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they
worth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have an
affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned
missions. As it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a

No, if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field, it produces a voltage.
The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or
move the conductor.  The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't
really significant, especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic
field is to begin with.


Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel
the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course,
this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has
to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the
earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require
some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.
And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).  And the
physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our
blood, among other things).  In other words, forget it.


I missed out on the ""dragless satellite"" thread, but it sounds totally bogus,
from this little bit.",put conductor change magnetic field produce voltage two way permanent magnet move magnet move conductor slow shift earth magnetic field not really significant especially consider weak earth magnetic field begin well would require generate incredibly large magnetic field repel earth magnetic field magnet repel another magnet course force work one direction magnetic field generate unimaginably powerful magnetic repulsion drop 1r3 earth magnetic field surface already weak would require sort unknown superconductor special nonmagnetic construction seriously hardenne electronic optical computer perhaps physiological danger would significant due iron content blood among thing word forget miss dragless satellite thread sound totally bogus little bit,2,sci.space

Introduction:

	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)
	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)
	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)
	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)
	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)

	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	This document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background:

	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).

	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


Proposed Charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]

Example Ballot #1:

	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes
	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes
	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no

	(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no

	(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John

	In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of
	comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view
	on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. 


Example Ballot #2:

	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes
	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes
	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes
	(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes
	(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes

	(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane

	In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all
	the proposals.


Voting Rules:

	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most
	  recent vote will be counted.

	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,
	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.

	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will
	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).

	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
	  In other words, a proposal passes if:
	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


Schedule:

	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted
	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the
	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you
	have not voted yet, vote now!

	The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on
	April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.
	The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
	date.

	To be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the

	is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take

"Hello Folks,

I'm very happy with my ""new"" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting
something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are 
my questions:

1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece 
detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.

2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it 
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM?  

3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section
of the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? 

4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?

The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the 
driveway when she sees me coming. Probably only hits 25mph, or so. (I made 
the mistake of waving to a neighbor. She has some sort of grudge, now.)

I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came 
flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with 
my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard 
me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from 
my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of 
the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the 
final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph 
from the other direction.

I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off 
the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front 
tire. It managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral 
imminent doom?) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have 
swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
home, but I haven't seen it since.

"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on
a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid
motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of 
aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent
Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.
The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect
some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made
a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what
you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The
foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,
so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major
improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the
principal failure mode for solid propellant.

   As for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one
   drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need
   to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization
   on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.

Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 million
km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2
per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off
with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an
unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft).
If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new
moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon.
You might have to abandon the colour, though.

Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit
unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base
to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur
compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your
uncle.  I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of
identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.

Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink
vendors? Who else might be interested?

Would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not
much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km
inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your
key growth market). I'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of
identity).",advertise sure not nasa friend spend one drunken night figure exactly much gold mylar would need put golden arch certain american fast food organization face moon fortunately sober morning hmmm actually not much like 2 million km2 think sound like lot ten m2 per burger say organization sell last year would well reflective substance could spray thinly unmanned craft lunar orbit rather large set craft get reasonable albedo would visible even new moon since moon quite dark bright full moon might abandon colour though buy cheap launch system design reusable moon lunar orbit unmanned spray craft build 50 say craft establish lunar base extract tio2 say colour would well sulphur compound suppose sort propellant bob uncle say 20 billion dollar plus change identity love one delivery date 2010 get fastfood chain bidding fizzydrink vendor else might interested would buy give lot expensive not much impressive put large set severalkm inflatable billboard leo geo visible 24 hour key growth market 5bn change identity,2,sci.space

UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design
    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.


    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters.


    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint
    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.
    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon
    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the
    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,
    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's
    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the
    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of
    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturn's rings.

    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have
    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data
    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from
    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve
    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made
    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon.


    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire
    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity
    map.


    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.
    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in
    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for
    one martian year (687 days).


    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched
    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the
    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.


    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.

    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole
    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its
    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!

    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see
    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical
    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.


    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron
    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro
    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based
    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.

    1993 Missions
	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]
	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform
	    a wide-field sky survey in the ""soft"" (low-energy) X-ray
	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search
	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white
	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also
	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron
	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos
	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development
	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the
	    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch
	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.

	o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]
	    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.

	o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]
	    Gather radar images of Earth's surface.

	o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]
	    Study of Stratospheric ozone.

	o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]
	    Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be
	    recovered after it conducts the various scientific and
	    engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and
	    retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.

    1994
	o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]
	    June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the
	    Earth.

	o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]
	    International Microgravity Laboratory.

	o ADEOS [NASDA]
	    Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.

	o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]
	    Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure
	    and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.

    1995
	LUNAR-A [ISAS]
	    Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the
	    moon's interior.


    Proposed Missions:
	o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)
	    Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space
	    observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for
	    15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.

	o Earth Observing System (EOS)
	    Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to
	    provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science
	    including planetary evolution.

	o Mercury Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch.

	o Lunar Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar
	    orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would
	    survey characteristics to provide a global context for the
	    results from the Apollo program.

	o Space Infrared Telescope Facility
	    Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of
	    the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with
	    a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and
	    other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic
	    birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant
	    infrared-emitting galaxies

	o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR)
	    Robotics rover would return samples of Mars' atmosphere and
	    surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for
	    imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.

	o Fire and Ice
	    Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of
	    Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in
	    2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice
	    components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking
	    measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is
	    vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out
	    towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.

"Hi Netters,

As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.
People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.
(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although
just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make
any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. 
However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.

Hello Buddy,

I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have
DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.

Here is my suggestion...

1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with
	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that
	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other
	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you 
	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)

2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95
	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I
	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!
	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with
	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It
	works great.  Not delays.  I think the ""A"" is better than ""B"" 
	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.
	I am looking forward to being able to ""LOADHIGH"" the DD sw.  That
	has been an annoyance.

3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the
	effort to upgrade.

Just my $.02 ...

Regards,
Mark Bagdy

Buddy,

I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The
documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic
installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.

There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max
& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a
203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had
~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and
such).

I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it
takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very
happy camper.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on
a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced
mode.
	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive
with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.
	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install.
The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game
was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed
region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. 
There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.
	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady 
around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files 
are compressed image files and some large zip files.  

If you have any more specific questions let me know.
Dan

I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40

product.

That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument

which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,
there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is
a non-seqitur.

Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity

When I was at the Texas Star Party a few years ago, the sky was so dark
that Venus did, indeed, cause light pollution until it set.

Even if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem.  Imagine observing an
object and halfway through your run, your object was occulted!

I would guess that most of the people stating positive opinions are not 
fanatically serious observers.

It is so typical that the rights of the minority are extinguished by the
wants of the majority, no matter how ridiculous those wants might be.

size.  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
most cases.

WARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not
result, but headaches will!

I've got a 386DX-40, 4MB and I'm using Windows 3.1. Sometimes I wondered why 
Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing (execpt having lunch
or something like that). Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and
Windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free. And so I'm still
wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the
convertional is sufficient? Any common-sense-explanation is really appreciated.

"Ken:

Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big
Boys if you're tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in
on the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son.


Ahem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be
Politically Correct to contend so.


It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an
operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of
the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's
the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,
to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  

There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling
away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any
zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for
this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual
billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will
no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:

DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping
development costs low and flying incremental ""X-plane"" hardware.
It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a
complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would
have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s
America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or
building the DC-Y.

I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any
expansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for
beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If
the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and
the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a
prospect too depressing to bear.

(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different
direction.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital
launch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for
small payloads.)

I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are
plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some
of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's
world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an
assembly line.

[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]

Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. 
The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which
includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle
operations, as well as the ""bird in the hand"" argument your common
sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the
Shuttle, not instead of it.

Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful
for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.


If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,
rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford
more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites
instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little
outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of
begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able
to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a
big difference in costs.

Unfortunately, things have been boding ill (is that a legitimate conjugation?)
for a while.  While the Office of Exploration had some great ideas, they never
got much money.  I've heard good things about Griffin, but it's hard to want
him back in a job where he couldn't do anything.


The group examining the Freedom-based space station redesign proposals is

Subject: Next stand-off?
Status: R

Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week
today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with
charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.

Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but
some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside
have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free
will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.

In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting
information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the
industry.  At times, he has claimed to ""have hardware which will blow
anything else away"", while more recently he claims they have stopped
manufacturing their own.

Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is
equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and
possibly Canon equipment.

The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to
other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,
including a young man who will identify himself only as ""Bill"" and
claims to be the ""MS-iah"".

Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak
hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work
20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were
frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of
""interpersonal computing"" which rejects traditional roles.

Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on
federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares
throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own
apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers
carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling ""I
want to welcome you to the 'Next World' "".",tom subject computer cult scott fri apr 23 163121 1993 receive igcapcorg 41revision 177 i d aa16121 fri 23 apr 93 163109 pdt date fri 23 apr 93 163109 pdt messageid 9304232331aa16121igcapcorg scott weikart scott sender scott cdplist subject next standoff status r redwood city ca api tense standoff enter third week today authority report progress negotiation charismatic cult leader steve job negotiator uncertain situation inside compound report suggest half hundred follower inside terminate other claim stay free job persuasive manner make hard confirm conversation authority job give conflicting information heavily prepared group war industry time claim hardware blow anything else away recently claim stop manufacture agent atf appletaligent force believe group equip serious hardware include 486caliber piece possibly canon equipment siege attract variety spectator curious cultist offer intercede negotiation include young man identify bill claim msiah former member cult recently deprogramme speak hesitantly former life include force work 20hour day subsist jolt twinkie frequent lecture indoctrinate theory interpersonal computing reject traditional role latenight vigil chesapeake drive take toll federal marshal loud rock roll mostly talk head blare throughout night fear job fulfill apocalyptic prophecy worry reinforce loudspeaker carry job speech typically begin chilling want welcome next world,2,sci.space

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contact:  OASIS (310) 364-2290

   15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA

     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.
  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD

   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-
inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.
Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.

   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David
Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.

   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space
Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the
National Space Society, which is an international non-profit
organization that promotes development of the space frontier.
The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is
about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar
Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources
(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
uranium reached $200/lb.

""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and
demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going
to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?
Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built
at a sufficient rate.

Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or
a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of
self-sufficiency.",hate pour cold water currently seawater extract uranium even use new improve fiber absorber japan 20 time expensive uranium spot market uranium cheap right around 10 lb right mine close not compete place like cigar lake canada ore rich present safety hazard mine work shield vehicle plenty source example uranium phosphate processing would come line uranium reach 200 lb demand supply balance collapse nonsense supply demand always balance change price uranium go increase price factor 20 end century not bloody likely new nuclear reactor not build sufficient rate uranium seawater interesting long term project project japanese might justify ground selfsufficiency,2,sci.space

controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS

and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders.  I wondering if
this is a problem.  Also, I remember how, when I helped my cousin
install his second IDE drive, we had to define a master/slave

I don't think Michael's response was anti-party but rather pro-environmental.
I agree that you gotta let us Hogs out to roam every once in awhile.  Let's
hope that next year Oatman will be better prepared and that we all pick up
after ourselves.


Well, I for one thought you told a good story, even if you say you are an
a**hole!:-) We need more biker experiances written to news.  It's unfortunate
that you got flamed for telling it, but we all know this is a controversial
group.

At any rate, keep up the good work and continue to post stories.",not think michael response antiparty rather proenvironmental agree get ta let we hogs roam every awhile let hope next year oatman well prepared pick well one thought tell good story even say ahole need biker experiance write news unfortunate got flame tell know controversial group rate keep good work continue post story,1,rec.motorcycles

   And so you damned well should  be...  young whipper-snapper!  It's  wet
   kippers at ten paces if there's any repeat of this sort of thing!

   Now, in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreck.moto, let's  mutate!
   Take your partners by the hand...

   On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours (when I -should- have been
   working) with a  torch, brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest
   holes in  Yamadog's exhaust  pipes (s'mazin'  what you  can do  with  a
   couple of AA  cells and a  three-volt bulb!).   I stuck some  ""gun-gum""
   into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike.

   So, last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold,  the
   sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is
   escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the
   port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat ""hole of Calcutta"" at the
   time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at
   the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose.

   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to
   tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good
   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold
   a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from
   the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel.  So, I stuff in a bit
   of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best ""gun-gum""  and
   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a
   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?

   Oh, and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  205
   and a  207  brazing  rod (made  by  ""Gaz""  [Yup!   the  camping  folks.
   Surprised the marmalade outa' me, too!] in that place just off the Isle
   of Wight) I'd be eternally  grateful (twenty-sodding-quid for two  rods
   and I don't even know what I'm buying.  Bloody kanji!).

": This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a
: way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)
: to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to
: get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!
: I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns

I'm not sure if this will work, but how about using one of those 'T' expanders
used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either
side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot, and then (probably) 
have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low
profile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot, 
and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at 
each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.  

The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics
on it.  The only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system,
that may not be a problem.

Don't know about performance, though.  I'll leave that discussion to the 
engineers.",may dumbest question year way piggyback expand 6slot motherboard 16bit get usual 8 case slot 8 would like get scanner card already max would hope simple solution exist eg adapter turn not sure work use one not expander use lowprofile case allow 35 slot stagger either side card install last slot probably 2 3 sideway slot actually do low profile case standard motherboard not connector one slot expansion card plug not guess could end slot 1 8 add even not connector simply track slot electronic downside case not close homebrew system may not problem not know performance though leave discussion engineer,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though,

it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air.

Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal.
After you learn the drill, it's pretty straightforward.

If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed
on during the drop, the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was
intended to do.  Conservative rec.moto'ers will recommend that you replace
the helmet.  If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately, you
should.

"Hi!

I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5"" drive 
(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives.

I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on
during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I 
try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?

I would be scared of trying to fit the one piece.  When I got my

	Yup.  Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, the cost of insurance
does NOT go down with No Fault.  The crappiest drivers make out like bandits
because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for
insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy
drivers.  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of
the crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair.

	Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of
shit, because the rest of us end up paying more.

	Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is
also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are
inherently less safe than slower drivers, and the NHTSA disproved that two
years ago now.

"This morning a truck that had been within my sight (and I within
his) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that I existed and pulled
over right on me -- my front wheel was about even with the back
edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him.

It was trivial enough for me to tap the brakes and slide behind him
as he slewed over (with no signal, of course) on top of me, with
my little horn blaring (damn, I need Fiamms!), but the satisfaction
of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough,
especially when I later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made
no apologetic wave or anything.

Is there some way that I can memorize the license plate of an
offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner?

"Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome
monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted
Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz
horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've
studied it.

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship
to reality.

a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker 3.0.
This was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact
that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. Does
anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stacker

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste*
on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, 
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,
scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have 
the money, why not?"" approach.

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you
put a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year? Even if you
use grad students?

"A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:

There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken
passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used to
ride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great,
even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due
in part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are
particularly slimline !

I always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes
their movements predictable.

My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,
I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.
Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers
(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,
making any kind of maneuvering difficult.

I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and
shifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about
a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
sitting very still and getting a sore back.

We have a code system for turns, stop and for 'I need to shift position'.",random thought ride passenger substitute bike sufficient power take passenger occasionally small 125 etc bike use ride uk hard ride gs1100 great even move freind gsx600 ride recently may due part fact neither regular passenger particularly slimline always tell passenger stay line bike corner make movement predictable regular passenger tend hold either rack nothing not really like passenger hold onto except short period may biased fact couple new passenger friend recently first time bike hold real tight making kind maneuver difficult also discover long trip prefer passenger move shift weight bit recently take work collegue meeting 1 hour ride sit totally still whole way leave also sit still get sore back code system turn stop need shift position,1,rec.motorcycles

I don't have to ""try reading a bit"", Pat.  I *work* as a government
contractor and know what the rules are like.  Yes, they sign some
(damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to
Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts;
they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties
when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it
(which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous
plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a
private space station with the government as the expected prime
occupant.

I'd like a source for that statement about ""the reason they aren't
cutting defense spending as much as they would like""; I just don't buy
it. The other thing I find a bit 'funny' about your posting, Pat, is
that several other people answered the question pretty much the same
way I did; mine is the one you comment (and incorrectly, I think) on.
I think that says a lot.  You and Tommy should move in together.

I've only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds, in
the winter, at a light, when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to
dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half
where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. I've never
had occasion to do it on a bike, but I imagine that it would be even
easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. Giving a gander

You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God
999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].

But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25"" disks.  I hate using 5.25"" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5""'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around.

Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing.

Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah.

Good luck....

I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume
that the general public ""can't handle the truth"" and then, based on this 
assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a
good argument, comes along and asks ""why don't you just develop the spinoffs?""
or ""why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the
military?""  There are some good arguments for space development without relying
on its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think
that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.


And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.
Teflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was 
conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the
trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.  Certainly velcro was 
available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties.  I would need to 
see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be here
today without NASA.

Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins
on the HST re-boost mission.  A while back i had asked why not carry
the EDO pallet up,  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough, they weren't even carrying extra suits.


Where's wingo when you need him:-)

COme on.   Knock that S**T off.

YOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning
for the repair EVA's.   Also during theøÄ   
Intelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations.
I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.

And as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it
bad enough.

YOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do
is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.

Don't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate
missions slip,   the Discovery won't launch on this mission until
March.  that's almost a year.


Ah,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.

YOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are
getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.

The time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally
planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA's  with 3 reserve
walks.

If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million
saved.  If the Weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days.
and  handle any contingency  problems,  that's quite a savings.



Of course,  there wasn't any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too.

as for the problems with the aperture door,  I am sure they can
work out some way to handle  that.  Maybe a Plug  made from

One of the things that police dogs are used for is to

As Charles said, many people are scared of dogs and will
panic when one goes on attack.  They will then turn their 
weapon on the dog and this allows the police officer to
take control.

A single person vs. a single dog in a face-to-face confrontation should
really be no contest.  The dog is no match for a human willing to fight.

": >Why not build a inflatable space dock.

: If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
: a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether
: anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near
: future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.

That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked ""Why not,"" I'll
respond.

Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other
factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control
is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to 
incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).
Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.
Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely
to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer
fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.

Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used
their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though
they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.

The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The
space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to
temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation
effects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibility
for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure
changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could
lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.

These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success.

I have it all constructed here and sitting inside a nice little grey ABS box.

Unfortunately I can't get it to work... I have a little demo here by the name
of Cronologia (Which the schematic came from) and all I can get it to pump
out of the box is data type hash/static with a small amount of music signal
behind it - it's even worse than the speaker inside the machine.

Does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas/suggestions/
better designs/improvements/wastepaper bin... etc?

Many thanks for a reply via this conference or email.

    CAREERS IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY

    In 1990 the Princeton Planetary Society published the first edition of
    ""Space Jobs: The Guide to Careers in Space-Related Fields."" The
    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to
    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in
    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to
    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second
    edition of the guide.

    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job
    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of
    ""Space Jobs"" features strategies for entering the space field and
    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and
    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate
    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing
    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an
    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as
    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

    HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON

    Official names are decided by committees of the International
    Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial
    organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and
    star maps describing where to find ""your"" star. These organizations have
    absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they
    assign are not used by anyone else. It's also likely that you won't be
    able to see ""your"" star without binoculars or a telescope. See the back
    pages of Astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact
    info; one such organization may be found at:

	""Fusion as Electric Propulsion"", Robert W. Bussard, Journal of
	Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990

	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion
	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the
	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values
	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are
	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust""
	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system
	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local
	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100
	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer
	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a
	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with
	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows
	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in
	    Earth/moon space.

	    [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version
	    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion
	    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch
	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in
	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising
	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the
	    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim
	    Bowery]

	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by
	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion
	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.

	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron
	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma
	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities
	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and
	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm
	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure
	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically
	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power
	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens
	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages
	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I
	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob
	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently
	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one
	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather
	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the
	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid
	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]

    I've been using the Build59 drivers on a GW2K 4DX2-66V for several
weeks with no problems. I'm running Windows in 1024x758 and all software
I've run has worked fine. This includes many games and the CD-based 
multi-media encyclopedia, on which the full-motion video works fine.
I'd recommend you give them a try.

"Hi,

I recently got a tower-case for my Gateway 486/33 file server, mostly because
we needed the extra drive bays and better power supply.  This case has LED's
for the processor speed, i.e. 33.  Is there a place to plug this in on the
motherboard?  If not, is there anyway to hack something to make it work?

I just installed a MC Power Arc II, and it seems to run great. I also
used MC coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC. A little soldering
and all was fine. Static timing was real easy to set too. 

On the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion I
invariably seek but don't always adopt, thinks MC Power Arc is a ""piece
of shit"" and says ""all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day"". 
Needless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and
recommends the Dyna-S system. I think that's the one with the
Hall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?",instal mc power arc ii seem run great also use mc coil neither ignition module coil require new mount hole drill 92 fxstc little soldering fine static time real easy set side coin local wrench whose opinion invariably seek not always adopt think mc power arc piece shit say jap chip gon na fail one day needless say not like electronic ignition module recommend dyna system think one halleffect time sensor correct,1,rec.motorcycles

If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration,
sure you can use chemical rockets for that part... but even just doing the
deceleration chemically is a major headache.  We're talking seriously high
cruising velocities; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto
orbit isn't easy with chemical fuels.

Incidentally, solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration
system for something like this.  They don't go anywhere quickly.  (I speak
as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project, although
that is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is dormant.)
They can't fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very
advanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun first.",get good propulsion system not useful deceleration sure use chemical rocket part even deceleration chemically major headache talk seriously high cruising velocity take velocity nearly zero pluto orbit not easy chemical fuel incidentally solar sail not go suitable acceleration system something like not go anywhere quickly speak head mission planning canadian solar sail project although less honorary title right cssp dormant not fly mission like unless start talk advanced system drop close sun first,2,sci.space

"Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter
than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big
presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more
bare-bones.

In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would
hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,
maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it
in.

After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written
questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only
had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.

So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question
being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.
Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all
the difference.

So, on to the substance. The question was 

Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such
as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete
with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed
by Mcdonnell Douglass?

Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,
then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last
part first.

This is to the best of my recollection what he said.

As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better
answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers 
about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High
speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at
this point.

So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial
arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that 
they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them
to persue work on their own.

Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,
this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this
guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space
lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where
the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman
of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are
trying to do something with it.  

Anybody know anything further?

"A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty nice

will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS

"        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no
notes so I'll try to wing it...  
        Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that 
black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,
M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking
appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,
they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any
of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the
galaxy.  
        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the
various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either
Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our
catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic
distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of
homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are
sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.
Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I
suppose you are saying, ""Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the
disk.""  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an
interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out
to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de
tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an 
analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from
the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile
away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his
arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,
and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe
find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  
        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I
said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short
timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of
behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound
to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.
When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,
but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see
not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources 
in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of
these characteristics.

Tell that to the people who run the 10-meter Keck telescope, or the 
astronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin 8-meter telescope
project.  It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building
Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, ""This
second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope
with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve
the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away.""   Japan's 8.3-meter
Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes
will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!

And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research
was done with ""Star Wars"" funding, and some is now being shared with
astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few
years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their 
theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.

To say that ""visible light astronomy is already a dying field"" is 
pure hokum.  To use the ""logic"" that things are already bad, so it doesn't
matter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields.

billion for that?  Wouldn't it be better just to spend the money on

wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M

"Orating with wild abandon, prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu (Henry Prange) offers:
%The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem
%in the summer. Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that.

I'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter,
and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.  

My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.
This has been complained about by every reviewer, official and
unofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting
is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things
just get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable
effect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature
about right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker
winter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I
received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for
the poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were
suppose to).

Vibration?  What's that?  I ride a BMW twin.  You can barely tell if
the engine is fired up or not most of the time, smoother than silk

I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
This is a ""physical layer"" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
I) physical identification scheme (number).

But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the
manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly
changable.

1- US COMMERCIAL SPACE SALES FLATTEN IN 1993
   The US Department of Commerce projects US commercial space sales 
will remain flat in 1993, with current data showing only a 2 percent 
growth over 1992.  As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993"" 
(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space 
business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. 
   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had 
shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are 
driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are 
projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 
satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also 
projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, 
and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to 
$450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward 
revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                           
   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, 
revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to 
increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from 
broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products 
and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993
   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial 
space industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad 
report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite 
manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth 
$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual 
projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market 
sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very 
successful in regaining international market share in the satellite 
business. 
   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in 
the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-
year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including 
such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) 
appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually 
publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and 
the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released 
then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if 
the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the 
numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. 
   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite 
promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top 
$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct 
broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite 
station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year 
through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic 
for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for 
substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the 
next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative 
assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and 
satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the 
current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite 
market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will 
be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive 
as currently projected.) 
   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first 
release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research 
facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for 
the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space 
Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first 
sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 

2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS
   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta 
launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola 
Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to 
launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO 
communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas 
was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. 
   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium 
constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium 
satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be 
launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle 
launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be 
launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  
Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a 
planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although 
details of the launch services contract were reported to be 
negotiation, and not yet final. 
   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of 
their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 
million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 
launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These 
launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global 
Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other 
programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is 
expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected 
to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  
Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand"" 
services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to 
occur within 40 days of the request. 
    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should 
provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program 
through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have 
a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and 
sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts 
for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA 
Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping 
MDC as a viable commerical launch company. 
    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these 
contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has 
not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for 
operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing 
and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these 
approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  
But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. 
   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of 
several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of 
the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III 
program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this 
time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future 
funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts 
is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy 
reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and 
Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs 
(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter"" 
program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget 
deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to 
find in the shrinking US Defense budget.] 
 
3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""
   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing 
satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of 
Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to 
WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and 
operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral 
images of the Earth. 
   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture 
by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the 
operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the 
request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new 
venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to 
provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into 
digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable 
customers for this service include exploration geologists, 
agricultural planners, and urban planners.  
   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 
1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last 
November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote 
sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to 
this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to 
all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures 
would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. 
   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote 
sensing ventures working their way through the system at different 
stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite 
systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing 
data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, 
government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures 
such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use 
innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the 
margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures 
appearing in the next year or so.] 
                 
4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT"" 
   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General 
Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, 
despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent 
analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever 
convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 
95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-
generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate 
management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are 
cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and 
$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of 
capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. 
   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has 
hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has 
restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, 
many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might 
be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space 
Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current 
problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected 
to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of 
about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space 
launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability 
of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits 
from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur 
program is back on track, this division will continue to show 
substantial losses. 
   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation 
is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  
To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional 
management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  
In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management 
team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with 
the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would 
indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch 
operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince 
customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would 
have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in 
marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for 
this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly 
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash 
flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction 
(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), 
or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the 
$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of 
change for any company.] 
 
5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND
   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is 
projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early 
February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which 
detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the 
next decade. 
   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant 
position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 
international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane 
holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 
contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long 
March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. 
   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can 
compete are projected to come from communications satellites with 
the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and 
scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand 
growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. 
   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of 
individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will 
continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with 
larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. 
Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications 
satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to 
about 3000 kg in GEO. 
   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain 
strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the 
decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace 
bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder 
demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques 
appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing 
or near-term transponders. 
   One of the significant possible changes in the market was 
identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian 
launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, 
investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade 
off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and 
other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities 
and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. 
   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and 
I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  
Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in 
the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new 
data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical 
transponders on orbit.
   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-
based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While 
fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the 
established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing 
demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-
multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space 
transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability 
service, but only from established point A to established point B. 
To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable 
between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, 
installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost 
millions or billions of dollars.  
   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground 
network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective 
solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is 
cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of 
thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite 
network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and 
has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is 
growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, 
it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to 
handle the increase in traffic. 
   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still 
growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But 
satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current 
generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of 
on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from 
last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch 
demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite 
launches over longer intervals. 
   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it 
looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-
supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual 
commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites 
per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up 
to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of 
about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, 
Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other 
systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per 
year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. 
   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial 
launches.]

6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT 
   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has 
spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety 
rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt 
the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation 
of range safety rules.  
   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of 
two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure 
typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at 
Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute 
before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was 
overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the 
communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the 
valid abort call. 
   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort 
command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an 
investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to 
launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. 
   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety 
Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This 
investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an 
incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their 
investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at 
lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used 
in the launch. 
  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an 
investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested 
by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space 
Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  
   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial 
investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are 
starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four 
different communications channels were in use during the test. After 
the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test 
director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops 
Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  
According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. 
Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the 
NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying 
the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing 
explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the 
best set being that clear lines of communications and clear 
definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and 
understanding of the mission rules were not established before the 
launch.  
   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these 
procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   
This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has 
been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they 
do with commercial aircraft problems).  
   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with 
procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance 
of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how 
specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 

7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED
   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new 
small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  
Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos"" 
winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"", 
launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is 
projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to 
an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 
kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used 
with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 
'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military 
establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of 
spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the 
Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia 
facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. 
   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new 
venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking 
for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house 
knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous 
commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. 
   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants 
of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being 
targeted or substantial financial backing.]

8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING
   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the 
results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial 
rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland 
Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary 
study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch 
site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected 
low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic 
considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal 
for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. 
   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the 
Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still 
proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland 
found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if 
substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected 
returns were too low to justify the cost of development.  
   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the 
feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:
  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage 
sufficient to recover setup costs?
  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?
  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?
  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the 
investment?  
   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at 
Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore 
Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against 
these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying 
on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]

9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING
   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush 
authorized space technology transfer for several joint space 
ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed 
use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that 
regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch 
vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first 
launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as 
a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into 
LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, 
including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  
Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in 
development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor 
launch vehicle as well as from the US. 
   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity 
in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small 
payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either 
Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  
However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout 
program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the 
Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on 
system).  
   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch 
system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of 
such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies 
have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche 
Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the 
Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to 
find any other European development work with even a rumor of 
funding for hardware. 
   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the 
Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting 
rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space 
launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled 
the country in the 1970's and early 1980's. 
   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally 
transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new 
civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de 
Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described 
as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket 
program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German 
firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq 
in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and 
tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package 
lagged that of the propulsion system. 
   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first 
scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B 
satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes 
cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has 
yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air 
launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this 
contract.] 

10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP
   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in 
late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract 
from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 
launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar 
Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish 
Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and 
offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According 
to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya 
launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-
enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like 
the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main 
alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service 
to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the 
Swedish satellite was not specified. 
   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and 
funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a 
small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From 
PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series 
rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar 
MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 
225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  
   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its 
first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 
2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired 
TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary 
engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder 
closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same 
building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, 
launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. 
Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the 
board of directors.  
   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least 
$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been 
searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to 
design, build and launch their first set of vehicles. 
   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help 
bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need 
much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real 
hardware.] 

11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED
    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications 
venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  
As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), 
headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist 
Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China 
Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional 
communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite 
system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the 
satellite's communications channels.  
   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the 
release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid 
January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of 
Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg 
scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional 
satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has 
been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 
M) through 2006.  
   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this 
venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  
While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the 
current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two 
separate sastellite ventures. 
   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat-
2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing 
Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and 
other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational 
model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing 
venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to 
Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later 
satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between 
Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture 
through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to 
proceed. 
   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with 
substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This 
is just another indicator to add to the list.] 

12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES
   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently 
announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and 
another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for 
advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been 
specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with 
manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 
1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's 
aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 
2000.                                 
   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its 
national aerospace industry, specifically including space 
activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are 
coming into the commercial space market. 
   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications 
satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 
on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide 
television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, 
southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. 
   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on 
Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US 
$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of 
this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""  
Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-
monitoring micro-satellite. 
   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth 
observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) 
project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean 
government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with 
optical and microwave sensors.
   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel 
military effort to establish the capabilities for building and 
launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a 
government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, 
funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  
expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the 
Korean peninsula.       
   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean 
is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing 
aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is 
offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as 
part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of 
consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports 
satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has 
announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  
   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  
Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector 
for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a 
South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition 
of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 

13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH
   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the 
results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and 
investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of 
March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the 
market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% 
of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a 
general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The 
increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which 
is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this 
trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite 
well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms 
which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its 
results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

(not that logic has anything to do with it, but...)
I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving,
or something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car
in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore, they
would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an
additional factor in attributing ""blame"".

Anyway, stickers on the window are less effective... no one has any problem
taking a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker, but it's a different
story with that that nice paint job on the door....

Uh, no. These burst detectors are just that, burst detectors.
They have no angular resolution.

Now a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution,
but we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances
neccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort
cloud or not.

We have one network, and trying to make two networks out of it
degrades what angular resolution we have.",uh burst detector burst detector angular resolution network burst detector could angular resolution not decent set different network distance neccesary determine happen oort cloud not one network try make two network degrade angular resolution,2,sci.space

     No, it's not true.  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, but
there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542):

* You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the
  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.

* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),
  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI
  drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to
  the SCSI BIOS, but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)

     Back in February, someone asked about IDE and SCSI (this question
gets asked again and again).  At the end of this message, I've included
an edited copy of my reply.  You might find it interesting.

===============================================================================

     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers
generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher
throughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk
($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a
good SCSI controller.

     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're
used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).
Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking
operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is
mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to
connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.
However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.

     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's
cheaper, and you'll have less headaches.


[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what
  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]

     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,
which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the ""better""/""high
performance"" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI
controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased
(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:

* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI
  controllers.

* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).
  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card
  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.

     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape
drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it
works only with Adaptec controllers.


     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a
high-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound
right, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,
you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and
Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI
controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape
backups).  If you want a copy of my ""Adaptec 1542 hints and tips"" file,
send email.

     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
the PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.",first please edit posting wade 50 line quote crud people already read make people much less likely help course not want help problem not true get scsi ide work together restriction least adaptec 1542 must boot ide drive way boot scsi drive ide scsi drive must disable scsi rom bio not sure though must also use special driver access scsi drive hmm know disable something related scsi bio not sure rom back february someone ask ide scsi question gets ask end message include edit copy reply might find interesting darryl okahata internet darrylosrhpcom disclaimer message author personal opinion not constitute support opinion policy hewlettpackard little green man follow day msdo application isabase scsi ide controller generally comparable throughput might get slightly high throughput scsi disk also pay disk 30100 case also pay much much good scsi controller note good scsi controller really show power use good multitasking operating system like pc unix unfortunately neither msdo window 31 good multitasking operating system performance advantage scsi controller mostly waste leave advantage able connect multiple device scsi bus advantage however note expect pay premium scsi device go use msdo stick ide cheaper less headache note follow true msdoswindow know future hold window nt unix generally find driver scsi device probably not exist unless use one betterhigh performance scsi controller typically busmastere scsi controller cost around 180400 street price driver allow connect controller popular namebrand scsi device either come card purchase 100 list price example driver kit adaptec ez scsi kit list 75 work adaptec scsi controller corelscsi people make coreldraw list 99 driver kit supposedly work scsi controller card aspi driver like adaptec central point pc tool do 80 support number scsi tape drive documentation list 40 tape drive unfortunately work adaptec controller yes run problem use highperformance busmastering scsi controller not sound right not true though one controller probably tweak system get work sound card floppycontrollerbase tape drive like cms jumbo 250 window 31 know hll back get scsi controller work various hardwaresoftware thank god tape backup want copy adaptec 1542 hint tip file send email problem not really fault scsi controller card problem really general hardware software design pc eg standard however add busmastere scsi card bring problem surface make visible,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"Hi,

I bought, on the net here, a mini-tower 386dx25 system.  It works fine, but
I have no docs on the motherboard.

Does anyone know who a manufacturer named WPI is?  That is the only marking
on the board that is not related to a chip/connector name.  It says
(c)1991, WPI

Also, this board has a connector at the other end of the motherboard, it looks
like this:

Me too, though unfortunately the ""Official Line"" is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. The examiner's
guidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of the
rider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just
when it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can't
think of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit 
to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the 
woefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figures
would (imho) reduce still further.

"I'm using Norton Cache 5.0, which is really nice but horrible incompatible.
Some games won't work it, my streamer software won't work with it and Windows
doesn't like it at all. But when copying or deleting lots of small files, only
NCACHE is really fast. You see, to write a file the FAT must be changed. But to
write 1000 files the FAT must be changed only once. Is there any cache program
out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my

discovered it DIDN'T WORK!!!  I sent it back to them, and they said they'd 
send me a refund check.  IT TOOK MANY, MANY, MANY phone calls and hate-mail, 
as well as threats of lawsuit to get back my $250.00!  In fact, it took TWO 
WHOLE MONTHS of calling and threatening!  Every time I'd call, I would be

"Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal
width hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac?
I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I
am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.
Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register
(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)
is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is
there a high bit, and if so, where is it?
Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and
what would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really very
clear (tseng.txt from  vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this.
My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 I
think.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the
non-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if your

": While I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be

I believe that this orbiting space junk will be FAR brighter still;
more like the full moon.  The moon upsets deep-sky observation all
over the sky (and not just looking at it) because of scattered light.

   small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some

   This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon
   as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't
 ...
   even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2
   at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti
   basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
   could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
   ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being
   mined today).

Why Paul, it's obvious.
Once chlorine chemistry has been banned on Earth,
as is being advocated by some groups, Ti prices will
sharply increase (we are of course not allowed to
assume any developments in Ti processing).
Lunar Ti will then be eminently competitive for
the trendy jewelry market and certain applications
of National Importance

(oops, this is sci.space... wrong rules of debate ;-)


Seriously, I'd say there is a flaw in Gary's analysis
in that he assumes an export oriented economy, maybe
the lunatics will just want some native Ti for local
use... as to why Lunar natives are cost effective, 
analysis has shown they will be critical in providing
a sheltered manufacturing base, technological innovation,

I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50.
I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's
external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be
made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing,
but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that
faster... 
I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times 
as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!",anonymous see post choice 80486dx50 80486dx250 wonder although dx50 fast path external cache not choice dx250 one make work properly localbus mean cache speed one thing speed block video io get fast willing speculate dx250 localbus 24 time fast dx50 probably expensive cheap,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"[discussing the use of IRQ 7]



To put it a little differently:

 - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.

 - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's
   time to send out another byte to the printer.

 - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it
   in the high-impedence mode.

 - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't
   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper.

   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and
   that certainly isn't a requirement.)

 - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance
   reasons.

      720K floppy drive

  * SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive, 18 months old

      Dr. T's Copyist Professional (scoring software)
      First Word (word processor - *not* the PD version)

      NeoDesk (improved desktop for Atari ST)
      Universal III (improved file selector for Atari ST)
      Miscellaneous software (including Uniterm communications software)

I don't know.  Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is
budgeted for the altitude change?

Henry,  any figures on the mass  (full)  for the EDO pallet  plus
it's dry weight?  How about for the dry mass of Bus-1?  it was
being de-classified as i checked last.

Also, I need.

1)  current orbital parameters of HST 

2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.

3)  Discovery's  DRY weight

4) HST's Dry weight.



So how long do they need to train?  a year?  2 years?  somehow
I think 2-3 moths should be adequate.


Also because they significantly lacked on-orbit EVA experience.  
The HST is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.


There comes a time in every project, to kill the management.

They can if neccessary, re-schedule the  HST mission.  December is
not a drop dead date, unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission.  



I suspect, the BUS-1, may not have enough basic thrust for the HST
re-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks,  or bigger thrusters.


My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not
a contingency.  My understanding is the mission  needs both
a new FOC  and work on the electrical system,  plus
another re-boost.   


Somehow, i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then
$500 million.

and the extra stuff is real cheap.  NASA has lots of suits,  MMU's,
and the EDO pallets are re-usable.  Oh, one double magnum of champagne,
now there's a couple hundred bucks.

Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not. If
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars, your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable. I doubt I have to mention it, but this trick isn't
quite so smart on a GoldWing, CBR600, any GSXR, or any bike with
fairing-mounted mirrors.

I was a little surprised, though, to find that you had your helmet on
your seat while you were centerstanding your bike. I usually leave my
helmet on until my bike is parked, if for no other reason than I
wouldn't want my helmet to be on any surface that I was about to start

 MS> Subsequent reads of the time add one.  There's no change possible

Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added
a small ""feature"" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock
via DOS system services, then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value.
This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that
errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock.

"Hi,
I've got a Multi I/O card (IDE controller + serial/parallel
interface) and two floppy drives (5 1/4, 3 1/2) and a
Quantum ProDrive 80AT connected to it.
I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from
it. I can boot from drive A: (which disk drive does not matter)
but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch,
the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is
not accessed at all.
I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I/o card
or floppy disk drive settings (jumper configuration?)
Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it.
Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM
Thanks,

Well, my driveway is... Just keep an eye out for the blue GLH Turbo that 
utilizes the ""hit-the-ground-running"" merging technique. 
At least I don't have a dog that you need worry about.

Last week while entering a sand/gravel covered intersection in the country, 
I caught something unkosher out of the corner of my eye (you know that 
disgusting sensation when great, as-of-yet unidentified, evil is about to 
intimately acquaint itself with you-- kind of like knowing that that darkening 
shadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good, because
it probably has something to do with a Boeing 747 behaving, gravitationally
speaking, much like a brick).  Negotiating my way into this intersection that 
somehow reminded me of Daytona beach (sans H2O, sun, & babes) I manage to get a
glance at my impending destiny.  Lucifer's own DOG.  Hell's secret blend
of canine-- Doberman and Rottweiler (it moved with the grace of a Doberman,
yet had the hulk and jowels of the Rottweiler-- a creature with a definite
*wrong* end to be at).  The picture in my mirrors was fuzzy, but there was no 
mistaking the fangs and saliva trail.  
To shorten a verbose tale, my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed above
and beyond the call of duty, carried the bike through the sand-trap (I honestlyhave no idea how), and left the minion of Beelzebub with a face that 
suspiciously resembles a Metzler tread.  No blood, though-- Rats.

Moral: I'm not really sure, but more and more I believe that bikers ought 
       to be allowed to carry handguns.

As I heard the story, before Albert came up the the theory
o'relativity and warped space, nobody could account for
Mercury's orbit.  It ran a little fast (I think) for simple
Newtonian physics.  With the success in finding Neptune to
explain the odd movments of Uranus, it was postulated that there
might be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit.  

It's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the
sun than Mercury.  I'm sure we would have spotted it by now.
Perhaps some professionals can confirm that.

   Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software
   programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card?

The Ethernet card doesn't use the IP number (32-bits, usually
#.#.#.#); it uses the Ethernet address (48-bits, usually
#:#:#:#:#:#). I have never run across an Ethernet controller that
cannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it.
DECNET requires this feature.

However, that said, there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet
address.  They are globally unique, the first three bytes being
assigned to the manufacturer by the IEEE, and the last three by the

A friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new
Yamaha Virago 750.  After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen
the brake pedal, &c. &c.) I've pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter
for me.  Compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his Honda, this
is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.

IMHO = in my humble opinion!!







I didn't say there was no value - all I said was that it is very confusing
to newbies. 


Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer
themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??



Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include
countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was 
right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But
that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
or better as a result, is absurd.

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.
And that was my original point.",imho humble opinion not say value say confusing newbie bill kid firstly motorcycle not steer rider secondly adhesion tyre road suspension geometry ground clearance motorcycle dictate quickly swerve avoid obstacle not knowledge physics rider ear seriously suggest countersteere knowledge enable corner fast competently could manage otherwise formal training country far aware not include countersteere theory find countersteere six year ago physics lecturer also motorcyclist not believe first say steered bike right make turn leave went analyse closely realize right interesting bit knowledge lot fun since tell other first sceptical interesting bit knowledge claim essential biker know corner fast well result absurd formal training view absolutely essential go able ride bike properly safely include countersteere theory newbie course confuse people unnecessarily right time far important matter learn original point,1,rec.motorcycles
"I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that
were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an
owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:
Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and
33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi
instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run
at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.

The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for
the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon
Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger
than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,
and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first
motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner
tube qualities?

The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current
rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought
100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be
very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.

I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the
front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer 
lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and
FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive
behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable
back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving
much better tire milage life. Any comments?

A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very
good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to
mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be
careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to
check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and
I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.

On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)
Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually
I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be
fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame
mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower
bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition
runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly
accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'
style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is
just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)

""Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier""
Sponsored by the Planetary Studies Foundation

The Planetary Studies Foundation is sponsoring a one week class for
teachers called ""Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier."" The class will be
held at the Sheraton Suites in Elk Grove, Illinois from June 14 through
June 18. Participants who complete the program can earn two semester
hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the
class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.

The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space
Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool
to get students excited about learning and interested in science.

Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:
     > Living in Space
     > The Space Shuttle
     > The Space Station
     > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society
     > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics
     > The Solar System

There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space
station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the
Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and
the Museum of Science and Industry.

Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United
States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by
the Planetary Studies Foundation.

The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring
Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President
of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9
which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June
17.

The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials,
continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest
tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an
additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any

"I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!

here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental
civil rights.   If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation
to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected
in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you
know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,
they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent
you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.

As an Amateur Radio operator (VHF 2metres) I like to keep up with what is

In about 30 days I have learned ALOT about satellites current, future and 
past all the way back to Vanguard series and up to Astro D observatory 
(space).  I borrowed a book from the library called Weater Satellites (I 
think, it has a photo of the earth with a TIROS type satellite on it.)

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational
constant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping,
no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine
psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also, 
recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth 
operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an
instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger.
The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place 
as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended 
lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its
inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).


My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable 
instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too
many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard.
There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my
car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon
of dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement and
confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt
to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally 
looking back at me.  

""Seven at One Blow!"" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing
my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs
of my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently
knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque
accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.  What I had interpreted
as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt.

Well, I agree.  I hope others chime in with suggestions on specific
technologies which could be applied towards the maintenance of an
Earth like atmosphere on a long-duration spacecraft.

Tim et al:
I think we should try looking at atmosphere first.
This seems to be the single most fundamental issue in keeping anyone alive.
We're all taught that when supporting a patient
you look for maintaining airway. So, in keeping with my trauma training
(and keeping my emergency medicine professor happy), I suggest that
we look at the issues surrounding a regenerable atmospheric circuit.

Jeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I
thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway
locomotives...

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the
front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In
practice I suspect most people do what you describe.


If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the
limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them.

My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip.

It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case, so
the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go.

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable.
There are other ""board"" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't
know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment.

I don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing/launch
in terms of stresses/misalignments/etc.  I would think of the reboost as
a gentile push, where a landing, then launch as two JOLTS which would
put more mechanical stress on the instruments.  Additionally, there might
be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden
landing.  Finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination 
problems if the instruments came back to earth.

Of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid
something that might be done in one shuttle launch.  Here's hoping

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US
Government? 
Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you?
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will
stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you? 

Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great
beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is
not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church 
stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation
and made it all null and void.. 

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what
ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..
Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason
or another, but who will give you a ""home"".. Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever..
There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and
offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..
Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will
not care.. 
If your worried about the US, do the same thing..

Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many
other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what
ever..

little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to

That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses
and PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be-
fore BATSE, having this widely separated ""Interplanetary Network"" was the
only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot
locate a burst (except to say ""It's somewhere in the field of view."").  With
two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector
to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,
one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these
locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the 
sky), voila, you have an error box.

BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,
but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like
to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.

You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe
(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen
in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be
a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss

US PLANETARY MISSIONS


    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed
    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground
    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the
    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in
    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the
    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed
    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a
    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted
    from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative
    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations
    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.

    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December
    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a
    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world
    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide
    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).

    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective
    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar
    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.

    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and
    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it
    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from
    this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the
    geological and biological sense.

    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that
    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information
    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times
    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface
    of an ocean.

    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work
    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away
    the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic
    measurements of MARINER 4.

    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket
    launcher autopilot failed.

    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to
    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no
    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian
    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once
    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup
    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.

    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe
    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in
    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,
    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974
    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed
    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which
    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.


    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph
    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide
    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new
    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft
    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on
    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.

    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first
    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally
    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead
    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to
    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6
    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,
    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would
    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.

    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER
    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to
    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through
    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever
    to do so.

    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER
    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made
    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus
    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere
    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the
    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the
    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day
    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before
    its batteries failed.


    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)

    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They
    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems
    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.

    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an
    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the
    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.
    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the
    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.

    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but
    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,
    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.

    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost
    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon
    and drifted off into solar orbit.

    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send
    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact
    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras
    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first
    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.


    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)

    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image
    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO
    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our
    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.
    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were
    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.
    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar
    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.


    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)

    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar
    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the
    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered
    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing
    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was
    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.

    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the
    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images
    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from
    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,
    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored
    the Tycho crater region in 1968.


    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)

    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on
    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June
    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse
    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for
    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes
    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of
    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was
    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is
    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and
    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.

    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran
    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a
    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep
    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command
    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until
    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the
    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.

    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the
    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the
    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,
    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until
    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.

    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit
    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in
    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording
    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in
    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut
    down on April 12, 1980.

    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.


    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)

    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March
    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched
    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,
    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and
    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare
    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,
    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.

    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their
    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered
    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and
    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major
    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous
    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.

    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets
    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep
    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive
    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle
    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was
    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.
    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,
    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.

    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,
    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly
    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was
    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on
    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10
    satellites and one more ring were discovered.

    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,
    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright
    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were
    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a
    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)

    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their
    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets
    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the
    location of the heliopause.


SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS

    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and
    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:


    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES

    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first
	     craft in solar orbit.
    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.
    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.
    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was
	     also a test for future Mars missions.
    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images
	     from surface.
    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.
    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.
    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8
	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were
	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.
    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil
	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in
	      1972.
    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's
	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished
	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.
    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in
	      1976.


    SOVIET VENUS PROBES

    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions
	       lost enroute in 1961.
    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with
	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in
	       February of 1966. No images were returned.
    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.
	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe
	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.
    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending
	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before
	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles
	       similar in 1969.
    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet
	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in
	       1972.
    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the
	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar
	       mission.
    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.
		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.
    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of
		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.
    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian
	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on
	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in
	     March of 1986.


    SOVIET MARS PROBES

    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased
	     enroute the following year.
    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian
	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.
    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian
	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red
	     Planet in 1971.
    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander
	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.
    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to
	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.
    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in
	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.
	     probe MARINER 9.
    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.
    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit
	     with its flyby bus.
    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest
	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to
	       human/computer error.
    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did
	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week
	       before scheduled Phobos landing.

    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even
    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have
    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,
    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a
    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been
    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now
    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their
    space program remains to be seen.


JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS

    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on
    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km
    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to
    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of
    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on
    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest
    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The
    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for
    a Japanese spacecraft.

    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail
    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby
    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third
    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).


    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,
    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten
    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first
    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget
    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.

    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An
    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists
    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March
    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The
    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt
    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.

    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and
    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten
    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,
    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and
    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into
    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the
    approach:

	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km
	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km
	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)
	Period		: 4.7 days


PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES

    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three
    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,
    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means
    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your
    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can
    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.

    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it
    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in
    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in
    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date
    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra
    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good
    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works
    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market
    bookstore.

    Other works and periodicals:

    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space
    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry
    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission
    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study
    some of the books listed above.

    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL
    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's
    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,
    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER
    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the
    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions
    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and
    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major
    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,
    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events
    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are
    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you
    probably know.

    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you
    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space
    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their
    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe
    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,
    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.

    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I
    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas
    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from
    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

anything can happen..

You don't *need* to, but it's desirable.  HST, like all satellites in
low Earth orbit, is gradually losing altitude due to air drag.  It was
deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach, for that reason.
It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter.  (It has
no propulsion system of its own.)  This is an excellent opportunity,
given that there may not be another visit for several years.",not need desirable hst like satellite low earth orbit gradually lose altitude due air drag deploy high orbit shuttle could reach reason need occasional rebooste eventually reenter propulsion system excellent opportunity give may not another visit several year,2,sci.space

Ah, there's the rub.  And a catch-22 to boot.  For the purposes of a
contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get
there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without
demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a
low priced system existed, there might be demand...  

I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage
low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably
be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to
'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...


This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other
words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,
navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. 
You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see
folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch
system comes on line.

I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept.  If
your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its
not 'wasted' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500
million, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.

If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.
I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of
handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser
Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.
It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower
resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent
PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation
processed PS.

The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for
the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.

We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was
accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript
processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also
accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but
Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is
responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our
camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's
demo though).

I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be
surprised if there are several.",current product available upgrade resolution one support postscript experience either good bad quality difference really noticable planning produce camera ready copy home high resolution notice talk laser jet 4 believe postscript not see advantage use pcl peice hardware plug lj4 work support language suit job besides not think pcl even capable handle 1200 dpi specification experience laser master winjet 1200 bring lj4 1200 dpi use postscript also fast print mode not postscript low resolution 600dpi think fast particular product use host processor process postscript even decent pc know go slow ie slow compare highend workstation process ps quality difference noticable almost worth wait ps process rather impatient use bw camera image rs170 gray scale image accept ms word hand winjet ps printer driver convert image postscript hand winjet postscript processor postscript render ram lot do shoot directly printer ps processor also accept ps file create source include do application window run time print ps processor responsible halftoning would say pretty good job camera image come good opinion not good laser master demo though not know many similar product would surprised several,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Ha!  ""North America Modular SPACE STATION construction"" :-)
Same apprach, same reasoning: ""construction occurs under assembly
line conditions, no random weather problems interupting site-work
on your home - better quality control"" -- sounds like first ""-""
point above :-)

Somehow I have a strange attraction for this idea (living in
a modular home maybe has altered my mind).  The only thing
that scares me is the part about simply strapping 3 SSME's and
a nosecone on it and ""just launching it.""  I have this vision
of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the
complete loss of the new modular space station (not just a peice of
it as would be the case with staged in-orbit construction).

     TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The 
satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section 
housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof 
mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The 
proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation 
pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered 
around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.

     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 
2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a 
single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be 
powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

"Greetings,

        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info, 
please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),
and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.

        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big
case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom
reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:
1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?
2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I
have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?
3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? 
I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?
What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?
Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if
I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- 
quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle
than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.

Any input is welcome.

While shopping for a passenger helmet, I noticed that in many cases the
external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL.  The
difference was the amount of inside padding.

My solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner 
from a sheet of .5"" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside
surface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion
with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with
the liner out.  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.

No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible
near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those
discussions, a
spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to 
some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with
it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on 
the sensors that might be carried.

Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle
would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --
certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA
for, e.g.,  launch support would probably 
cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.


No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per 
Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to 
see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, 
the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure
would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was
(or a parade balloon, for that matter).

While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got
a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived
intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting
only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly
draw attention to space.   

Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.


As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.

I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.
Commercial projects, however, generally don't get ""funding"" -- they
get ""customers"" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.

For what it's worth, I got my can in three days from Chaparral. That's
UPS ground from CA to UT, YMMV. The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't
attract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test, a full
day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the
sand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with
sand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean.

As far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can
tell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-order
it if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories
always seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse also takes a week or two, and after trying to buy some boots
from them last week, I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW was
about $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but on
Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW a
completely unreasonable question: ""Do you have them in stock?"" The
conversation went something like this:

I need to know if you have some boots in stock.

	Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard?

I want to know if you have them in stock.

	Well, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call the
	distributer to find out if we have them.

So do you have them or not?

	Don't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our
	distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.

Uh, right. So can you do it?

	Yea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil.

So an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and call
him back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either,
but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month
(3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called
Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock:

	Ooh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock,
	but I'll check. What size?

Size 10.

	Let's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black...

I'll take the blacks!

This was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Once
again, three days via UPS ground. I _like_ Chaparral.

I'm not completely down on MAW, they often have lower prices, but be
prepared to wait.

One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was
the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just
been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed
several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the
Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last
year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the
ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I
scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it
scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.

Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading
reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the
criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product
testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly
know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently
from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of
what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply
more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell
anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you
don't also understand the scoring.",one monitor review june issue window magazine mitsubishi also review new nanao f550iw release last year may 92 issue window review several monitor include nanao t560i question nanao monitor well available year last year difference rank good window rank window source due mainly difference testing criterion scoring use different test score differently nothing wrong mitsubishi score highly test point shy perfect incidentally one thing everyone read review product whether monitor mouse read criterion methodology carefully unless know product testing do score base not possibly know really mean see rank monitor differently window source meaningless without know rank likewise impossible tell whether monitor meet need unless know testing may not apply likewise may apply closely one review another not always tell anything read 300 word commentary write not also understand score,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

   You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one

an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they
want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then
using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)

   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be
modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able
to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't

"In the April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"",
Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:
  ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes
   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like
   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the
   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts
   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the
   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to
   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about
   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10
   billion won't be spent on anything having anything
   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion
   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done
   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting
   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the
   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the
   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are
   getting and the price they are paying and note that
   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware
   that a third of the money is going for something else.""

My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple
of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I
talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station
at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a
response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed
to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz
data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend
in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers 
Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF
to 15,000 science teachers.]

First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does
exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'
for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.
This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4
center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at
$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is
04/2.2 = 1.8%

Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30
billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to
$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I
will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket
change.

I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could
be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some
states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it
take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*
subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in
front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds
go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax
rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the
center, and not to the prime contracts.

This leads to the obvious question ""What is the government
doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?
(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A
big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens
to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten
up by the center tax?)""

At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting
development funds (as they are supporting the development
work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to
setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical
power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life
solar array field (left over from solar cell research
research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries
(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC
switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated
loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system.

We have also used the supporting development money to
purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life
testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in
Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone.
38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the
on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).

As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations, for performing system
analyses (like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system, availability calculations
using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a 
database with information on weight of the power
system elements).

Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all
go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director
does control a small discretionary fund. Each year,
any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.

Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'
services at the Center, like the library, the 
central computer services division, the Contractor 
who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get
an accurate figure, you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library (for example),
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support SSF (which would be hard to
compute by itself - how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for
1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on
the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week
versus the rest of the center personnel). You would
then have to compare this estimate of the SSF
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,
maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but
we underpay for snow removal? Talk about

"LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics

               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists 
          CLAIM to be looking for a ""Unified Field Theory"" in which all 
          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single 
          set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically 
          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! 

               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
          calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of 
          space and time: 
    
               (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."" 
    
               (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."" 
    
               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-
          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL 
          DATUM""). 
      
               At each step in the development, Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles 
          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star 
          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white 
          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY 
          BURSTS). 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of 
          matter. 

               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy 
          complex mathematics, in his books.

          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer 
          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he 
          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used. 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same 
          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally 
          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in 
          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. 
    
               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been 
          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! 
    
               ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"", 
          ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. 
    
    
               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, 
          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or 
          still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring. 
    


          ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super 
          Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific"" 
          value. 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY 
          particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.) 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, 
          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are 
          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment. 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! 
    
               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 
          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money?! 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground 
          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the ""Supercollider""?! 
    
          
               Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as 
          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. 
      


          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made, in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, 
          which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"". 
     
               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, 
          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their 
          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each 
          other. 
      
               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half. 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, 
          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to 
          help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"". 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by 
          INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his 
          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special 
          Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near 
          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 
          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low 
          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. 
          [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing 
          about this.] 
    
     
               In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  
          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY). 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific 
          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 
          pages, indexed, hardcover. 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and 
          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-
          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white 
          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS! 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success: 
          In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also. 
    

 
          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS

               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were 
          originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the 
          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence). 
    
               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of 
          his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the 
          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls 
          the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the 
          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and 
          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at 
          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects, and come from all 
          directions uniformly.) 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to 
          stop it! 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B. Larson. 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is 
          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" 
          and in some of his other books. 
    
               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate 
          energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the 
          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements. 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some 
          of his books [better than I can]. 
    
               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. 
    
               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R 
          Diagram. 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space, making a single lone star 
          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system, orbiting each other. 
     
               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown 
          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron 
          stars"", ""black holes"", etc.. 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single 
          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf 
          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably 
          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! 
      
               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all 
          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law. 
          


          ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!

               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black 
          holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and 
          concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original ""black holes"". 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black 
          holes"", etc.! 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is 
          clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black 
          hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to ""prove"" their theory. 
    
    
               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is 
          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and 
          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT! 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of 
          Unified Science). 
          
          
          
          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe.  I quote one paragraph: 
    
               ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  
          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It 
          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in 
          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the 
          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open 
          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, 
          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system.  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  
          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."" 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).  
          (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, 
          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and 
          ""below"" labels mixed up.] 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-
          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light! 
    
               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge 
          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle.) 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds. 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has 
          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in 
          his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"". 
    
               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as 
          the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such 
          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, 
          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and 
          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. 
    
          

               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).

for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going?
How about for an EISA machine?

If the limitation is a software limitation, I can work around that by using
OS/2 1.3 on my PC-286.

"Hi:

I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!
I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  

     -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)

     -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)

     -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under 
	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel

     -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, 
	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of
	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.

I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,
and decided that a ""nice"" system (price/performance) would be:

	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus
	15"" monitor, 1280x1024 NI
	3Com Etherlink III 16bit
	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive

However, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise
surprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even
have a 50MHz local bus running...

I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus
the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind
that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any 
speedy help would be appreciated even more!!)



BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following 
configuration:

	486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram
	14"" monitor, 1024x768 NI
	SMC Ethercard 8 bit
	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive

We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!
~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or
been uncovered!  

There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish
running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take
a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).

There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive
don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with
medium size images.

I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This
machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec 
on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases
transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large 
images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it
make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice 
(above), for that reason.

Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

Any information is greatly appreciated.

For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC-36 tape drive
and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 EISA system with no
luck. I end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read
part of the test. I am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are
set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,
retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the
same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. It has been
suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down.
My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting
option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this. Am I going to
have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work
around? I will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions.
Tony

fc> Exactly what fraction of current research is done on the big, 
fc> visable light telescopes? From what I've seen, 10% or less 
fc> (down from amlost 100% 25 years ago.) That sounds like ""dying""
fc> to me...

 That doesn't seem like a fair comparison.  Infrared astronomy 
 didn't really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it
 didn't explode until IRAS in 1983.  Gamma-ray (and I think 
 X-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s.
 I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in 
 general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms)
 observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost 
 no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s.

 Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only 
 had access to optical or radio instruments.  Now, with far more
 instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has
 resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of 
 total astronomical work.



fc> That would be true, if adaptive optics worked well in the visable.
fc> But take a look at the papers on the subject: They refer to anything
fc> up to 100 microns as ""visable"". I don't know about you, but most
fc> people have trouble seeing beyond 7 microns or so... There are
fc> reasons to think adaptive optics will not work at shorter 
fc> wavelengths without truely radical improvements in technology.

 Hmm, some of the folks in this department planning on using 
 adaptive optics at the 5 m at Palomar for near-infrared 
 observations (1 and 2 microns) might be surprised to hear this.

 And isn't the NTT already pushing toward 0.1 arcsecond resolution, 
 from a ground-based site (remember 0.1 arcseconds was one of the 
 selling points of HST).

"Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks

I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5"" hard drive, model
LPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior.

Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks.

When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never
comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not
the drive.]

My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kind
behavior.

Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?

this purpose (in real time, 20-25 frames/second).
Hence we need frame-grabber cards and/or DSP cards for SUN or PC platform. 

We are also very interested in receiving comments and suggestions from users

"Okay DoD'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya !

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there
was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension
to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
tangible ""thunk"".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. 
My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such
that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the
lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a ""bank-follower"", or a
little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a
100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7
mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the
mystery.

The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm
fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of
the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in
the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something
having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  

Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you
rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without
damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo
that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly
changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid
?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life
goes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.",okay doder goddamn mystery ya today turn 90 degree corner like day slight difference rough spot right path cause suspension compress mid corner part bike hit ground tangible thunk pull first opportunity sus damage bike kawasaki gpx250r footpeg hinge spring fold upward backward contact ground etc low extreme corner peg mount bankfollow little stud theoretically first bit hit ground 100banked turn stud mount footpeg thread bit 7 mm long screw thread hole footpeg mystery stud side bike clunk turn absent fairly sure event damage end footpeg stud would ordinarily fact thread hole footpeg perfectly intact evidence something forcefully rip moment previously okay engineering type fk explain rip tightly fitting steel thread thread hole alloy without damaging thread hole sort hitech design thingo kawasaki never mention like end footpeg suddenly change phase impact let stud rip change back solid quite amazed could happen meantime life go without lefthand bankfollower,1,rec.motorcycles

   . . . David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,
   'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud.

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there
   isn't a mechanism for the others either.

What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""?
Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.

_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
least it was a good try...",evidence indicate gamma ray burster far away give enormous power wonder quantum black hole something like fairly close would galactic range david give good explaination deduction isotropic edge distribution whit either part universe part oort cloud not earth centre edge occuring edge gravisphere know not mechanism not mechanism other either earth gravisphere anyway decay pioneer venus orbiter gamma ray detector ulysse detect bright burst earth orbit detector burst least oort cloud distance principle four detector space au would see parallax burst solar system origin problem oort cloud source absolutely plausible mechanism propose would involve new physics far tell close conventional oort source model bfield pinching comet get many hole count least good try,2,sci.space

The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt
to market it.  They're basically happy with their government business and
don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.

A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go after
multi-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing
task quite significantly.

They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time
to get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars
Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had
prevented launches from it for a year or so.

There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So
was that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached

"Hello everyone.  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't

1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have 
to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too 
ignorant to know I need to buy)

2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in

till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes
a difference)

3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?

4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a 
state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then
get a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about 
learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence
and b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could 
teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either ""do you live near a

of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for 
the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.

doesn't seem too viable.  Any stories on how you all learned?

Les,

	I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for
low emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor.  It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at
that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)
issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any
difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's
Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.
But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a
bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim ""low
emissions"" but not specifically ""MPR-II Compliant"" or ""MPR-II Certified""
only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.
	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you
may be more discerning.  Good luck!

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.
That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the
only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who
witnesses a crime can do so.

Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a
description of the car and the license number, and tell them the
specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill
out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any
ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to
appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight
as a cop's.

Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.

The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.
The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to
CGA - but useful for my laptop).

Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?

I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer
is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said
sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway?
A UK support dealer said ""Circuit diagrams? Sync?""

So any ideas.

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says;
it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving
commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the
probe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing
and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish
communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods
when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows
that we haven't forgotten about it.

Hope that's clear enough to be comprehensible.

    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on
    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.

		     (1/3.4)
    D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km
	 g  p  f  n

	       (1/6)
    S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than
     g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface
					    e		      t
			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is
			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
			      other bodies.

		(1/3.4)
    S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,
     p	  a   t							    t
			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U
			       a
			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average
			      rock on the continental shields.

    C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km
			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).

							    (1/3.4)
    K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)
     n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U
			      nuclear test crater.

	      3		   2		       19
    W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )
			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent
			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile
			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3
			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.

    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing
    asteroids.

    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor
    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in
    diameter.

    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):

    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy
    diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)

     10			    10		     10^-8		10^9
      1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6
      0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3

    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT
    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.

    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY

    Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the ""Encyclopaedia
    Brittanica"", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing
    in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with
    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).

    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John
    Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS
    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32
    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both
    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a
    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.

    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,
    ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This
    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are
    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.

    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:
    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National
    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and
    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.

    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,
    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call
    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a
    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up
    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.

    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:

	R. Miller and F. Reddy, ""Mapping the World in Pascal"",
	Byte V12 #14, December 1987

	Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A
	demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data
	is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.

    THREE-DIMENSIONAL STAR/GALAXY COORDINATES

    To generate 3D coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an
    astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and
    parallax for the objects. Convert parallax into distance using the
    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates
    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and
    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and
    scale this by the distance.

    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog
    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or ""The Catalogue of Stars within 25
    parsecs of the Sun"" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on

"Hi
	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3
86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say ""Buy the memory
from us"" or something like that.)

	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I
asked them why, and all I got was ""Your point is well taken, but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""

	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to
get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.

	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less
busy"".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),
although evenn that might be a misprint.

there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I

I ride constantly, she rides four or five times a week. Even if you count

You're assuming that ""go solar"" = ""photovoltaic"".  Solar dynamic power
(turbo-alternators) doesn't have this problem.  It also has rather less
air drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big
solar plants at low altitude.

Now, you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often,
unless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.

 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. 
 Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for
 a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.
 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using
 SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which
 results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit
 and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software
 drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI
 interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term
 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},
 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit}.

8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 
that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software
controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds
for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT
NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit
SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1
electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider
16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but
4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1
but is 8-bit SCSI-2.
Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.",davidccatuucp dave write talk scsi1 device eg hd scsi2 controller rewrite mac info sheet scsi section scsi external device expansion interface common mac ibm allow use device hard drive printer scanner nubus card expansion mac plus monitor cdrom normal asynchronous scsi 5 mhz fast synchronous scsi 10 mhz difference mode mainly software driver main problem lot external device internal terminate cause problem two devise scsi port scsi chain suppose terminate begining end set cause problem either mac ibm scsi1 8bit 7 device per scsi controller asynchronous 15mb ave synchronous 5mbs max transfer 8bit scsi2 often mistaken fast version scsi1 see scsi2 detail scsi2 fully scsi1 compliant scsi2 mode 10 device per scsi controller 8bit scsi2 implimente fast scsi1 since run use scsi1 hardware software driver limit 7 device result sometimes mistakenly consitere part scsi1 16bit 32bit scsi2 require different port electronic scsi software driver scsi1 make expensive scsi interface 32bit scsi seem run synchronous mode hence term wide fast scsi transfer speed 46mb 10mb burst 8bit 812mbs 20mbs burst 16bit 1520mb 40mbs burst 32bit 8bit scsi2 big headache due fact scsi2 know pump scsi2 speed scsi1 device software controler main implimentation mac though see add scsi2 10mb maximum throughput pcs since 8bit scsi2 not need hardware include electonic software 16bit 32bit scsi2 cheepest scsi2 interface pop scsi1 electornic pop 8bit scsi2 electronic people consider 16bit scsi2 really start use one 46mb average though put theoretical burst 10mb not scsi1 8bit scsi2 rule thumb scsin 5mbs type scsi2,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

             The Lunar Tele-operation Model One (LTM1)
             =========================================
                        By David H. Mitchell
                          March 23, 1993
 
INTRODUCTION:
 
In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a
real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test
tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals
located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment
purposes.
Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and
tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of
information
on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of
a
lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating
educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and
achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in
Twenty-First century remote learning methods.
 
Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests
and
skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,
interfacing
and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving
playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and
professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at
a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at
the
LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real
facility
exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the
construction
of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested
by the users themselves.
 
This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:
 - tele-operations and virtual reality research
 - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation
 - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers
 - art and theater
 - bbs and online network users
 - software and game developers
 - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains
 - children
 - the child in all of us
 
LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:
 
A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used
for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.
The ""floor"" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions
is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and
creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and
machine-lets.
 
 The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:
 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;
 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and
 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.
 
 Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on
 it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture
 content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent
 to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.
 
The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains
with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control
electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will
receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their
data link to LTM1.
 
Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a
servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the
SSTO
to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar
landscape and land.
 
Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped
bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators
worldwide
to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and
takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on
commercially
available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the
interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced
ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.
 
By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding
a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be
provided in under 80 man hours.
 
PLAN OF ACTION:
 
The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by
providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network.
Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction
of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be
modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide ""rail stock""
for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical
communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.
An initial ""ground breaking"" with miniature shovels will be performed for
a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial
models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for
historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely
serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional
building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and
the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution
world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be
issued
calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale
models
for the simulated lunar colony.
 
A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then
be
announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to
find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of
the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that
time
the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will
then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return
to
their campus.
 
A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via
conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment
addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.
Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo
opportunity for the television community. Especially since the ""action""
will
be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be
invited to issue ""challenges"" to engineering and human factors students at
universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform
lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be
simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.
 
The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,
experimentation
and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a
long
term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic
example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited
to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can
lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!
 
CONCLUSION:
 
EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has
ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a
globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation
purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create
world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require
real
(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in
space.

good point.  the ""list"" actually started out as an extension of my GS
v. FJ shootout list, which is why it got that name.  since inception,
however, other boxer-interested folks have joined and the conversation
has not always been ""geared"" to gs/pd/st-specific topics.


when i raised the ""to expand or not to expand/that is the question""
question on the list itself, there were mixed feelings.  the list has
always been open to anyone with a non-bouncing ""from:"" line and there
has been general agreement that only boxer-related stuff is
appropriate.  almost all of the subscribers own R80/R100 GS/ST/PD
bikes, although some R, RT and RS owners are also on it.

at this point, my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace
and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as
possible.  the list is fairly technical, with ""how do i do this?"",
""what kind of that should i get?"" kinds of questions.  there has yet
to be any non-BMW bashing, K bike bashing, or ""any bmw mfg'd after
1962 is a piece of shit"" bashing.  such posts are, by consent of the
governed, proscribed.

if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the
net.boxer.owners, then i am not going to stand in the way of progress.

so, hesh, let me turn the question around: have you (or has anyone
else) not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded?

Voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the
solar system.   All it's doing is collecting  fields  data,  and routinely
squirting it down.  One of the mariners is also in stable
solar orbit,  and still providing similiar  solar data.  

Something  in a planetary orbit,  is subject to much more complex forces.

Comsats, in ""stable "" geosynch  orbits,  require  almost daily
stationkeeping operations.   

For the occasional  deep space bird,  like PFF  after pluto,  sure
it could be left on  ""auto-pilot"".  but things like  galileo or
magellan,  i'd suspect they need enough  housekeeping that
even untended they'd  end up unusable after a while.

The better question  should be.

Why not transfer  O&M of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding
to support these kind of ongoing science missions.

	When ongoing ops are mentioned,  it seems to  always quote  Operations

": As far as I can tell, the MD is an offshoot of technology that already exists.
: It is an MO drive.  MO drives exist already for computers.  They're expensive
: and a bit slow, but the disks are cheep (128 mb disks).  Dan.

I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new
digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice
it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of
how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone
from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply ""MD
is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data"", then when
pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!

What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio
player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system
can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up
the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!

he sent it back.  Unfortunately, the replacement also was distorted.  I would
bet it's a common problem.  The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors

"Several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet
intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance
between us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dog
suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and
the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier.

Apparently, it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth, if a dog
decides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as
many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. 

I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which
has a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff)
but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of
the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble
getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'd
def feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier
leg chewing target for those mongrels.

If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite
complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running
over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO
compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the
ground by said dog and dies from a head injury.

"Press Release No.19-93
Paris, 22 April 1993

Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of
their experiments

""Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not
be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided
a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s"". This
summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300
participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in
Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by
the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for
the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).

OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :
-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of
       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small
       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested
       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,
       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few
       examples.

-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services
       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-
       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over
       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.

-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS
       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,
       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and
       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.

When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the
world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other
satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four
different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.

OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some
of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is
given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or
services; over the past four years some 200 companies and
organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over
100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning
organisation.



As the new technologies and services tested by these

I suggest that you go direct to the original (and preferred...best quality)
source for all of this, just as you would (at least, should) for the chips
themselves:  National Semiconductor.  you can reach them at 1-800-272-9959.
they no longer package the data sheets in a book, as they did when I got
mine, but you can get them as individual sets of data sheets.  you want, as
a minimum, the following:

   *) 2 sets of data sheets:
      *) NS16450/INS8250A/NS16C450/INS82C50A
      *) NS16550AF

   *) 2 application notes (yes, GET THESE!):
      *) AN-491 The NS16550A: UART Design and Application Considerations
      *) AN-493 A Comparison of the INS8250, NS16450 and NS16550AF Series
         of UARTs

both of the application notes I listed have proven to be AT LEAST as
valuable as the data sheets themselves (more, actually).  AN-491, in
particular, is an exceptionally well-written application note that goes
into detail about how and why the 16550 does what it does, and how best
to take advantage of it.

btw, they send these out free, as long as you don't abuse it.

There are a number of other factors that are very important, the three

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside
of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the
stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air

Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of
the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside
long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.
Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from
escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion
chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)
to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they

"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can
be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at
mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.

Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on the
outside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback with
integrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from file
geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much
of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The
white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte
Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)
pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting
can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass
properties of the Station change during assembly.

The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because
it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong
part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are
limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the
docking system.

The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional
launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit
(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never
had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to
(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual
de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the
residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from
impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a
Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating
the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing
further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,
it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the
nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.

The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment
Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used
for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system
which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a
controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we
did with Skylab).

The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be
used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity
on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device
for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on
one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.

This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,
data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work
done to date.

Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,
and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors
I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
seems more likely.

Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;
you should see his notes in the GIF files.  

Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for
anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll
let you all know when I get that done.

That figure (1/4"") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...
on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12"").


I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to ""factory-spec"" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15"" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a ""perfect"" monitor
(the definition of ""perfect"" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).


I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was ""normal""). The short answer is no, don't accept these
""imperfections"" as ""normal"" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

Not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for
the mother ship that can't be applied to the probes.  Otherwise it's
better to simply launch the probes independently.  The outer planets
are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going
to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on
the way to Neptune.  Don't judge interplanetary trajectories in general
by what the Voyagers did:  they exploited a lineup that occurs only
every couple of centuries, and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect
route to Neptune.

Responsible and in love?  I believe that's a contradiction
in terms.

Unless you're really brave (read: ""reckless"") a 500cc sport
bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first
year of riding.  Getting more than that really is overkill,
as you'll never even want to use it.  The following bikes
can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice
to manage, and are plenty high performance:
    Kawasaki EX-500
    Honda VF-500 ""Interceptor""
    Suzuki GS-550E

The 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is ""way
sooner than you're ready for it"".  :-)  With something
as small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more
power pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :).

Now, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill
yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plenty
of people have started riding on those bikes and done
just fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste of
money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.
You'll never get the throttle more than half open
anyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?

Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are
	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card.

VGA:	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked
	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About
	 1/2 the speed, as I recall.

	 The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the 
	 P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid
	 is the only one I know about (I don't know about AMI) that uses
	 the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster.
	 
	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as
	 the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.
	 (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)

Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look
like?

"Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight
to the human being.  I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.

So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk
about it; I shall.

I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and 
probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands
the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence
of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.

I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only
communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.

A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science
variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long
expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational
to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to 
compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical
journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,
ideas for further research and development could be put forward for
the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take
part in the excitement of exploration.

Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week
to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition,
we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls
of NASA and industry.

eager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding

"After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD

Two points:

First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. 
Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body.

Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising
through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats

"You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE
interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info
sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the
info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:
Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some 
 specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller 
 specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a
 SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2
 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it 
 needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be 
 very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst 
 {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and
 reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between
 SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.

IBM
HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:
[...]
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics 
 currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.

So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES 
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode
it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.
The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its
cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the

There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive.  Any ""built-in"" drives e.g. IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I
have seen a similar situation before.

This is a common misconception.  There was nothing ""off the wall""
about the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number
of other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew
models, they had a wind tunnel.  In short, they were quite mainstream
and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.

I suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates?
Combs?  (I can never remember which it is--the guy that had the FBOs
and owned Learjet for a while).  These are both in print and easily
obtainable.  The Bishop's Boys is in trade paperback, even.

Even better would be the multi-volume set of the Wrights' writings,
but this is out of print, rare, and hideously expensive.

He also ignores a few other things.  While organics would become
significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus
some things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly
an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  As
supply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become more
competetive.  He also needs to consider that there has been an
estimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared
about petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem to
have about a 30 year reserve that we know about.

[I'm not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look as
hard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly true
during hte 'oil crisis' days of the 70's.]

Date: Wed Apr 21 19:01:49 1993

The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple 
and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an ""idle"" temp - not doing lots of
bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This
is in a Micron computer, without heatsink.

I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off.  It
makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to

Rob,
Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks
of use, mine did...
As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan
on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink
instead. Work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about
is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out)
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what
you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not
had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled
circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes
above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if

"[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated]
If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.
There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and
the software.  THAT IS IT.
Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.

SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}
 asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}
 synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a
 rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}

SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from
 SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs
 this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers
 AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the 
 slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 
 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous
 mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}

SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things
 over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the
 machine and the external device.
 Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver
 software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.
 Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.

SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this
 requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING
 devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY
 expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts

Doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more

Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never
be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no
materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low
grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, 
and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat 
sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military
weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space 
travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as 
Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor 
activity in the global scope of things.

Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent
calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's
too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories
that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna
has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital
sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers
a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,
and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and
heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity
wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.

We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually
ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to
deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more
expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the
easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few
centuries, if not much longer.

Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio
astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site
of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for
defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is
unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.
The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good
enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for
conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a
bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little
ultimate profit either.

If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, I have
the same question.  Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the
adjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? 
Obviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are
measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims?

"The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,
but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....

Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,
based on information provided by NASA headquarters.

The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the
Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The
day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics
covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for
the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the
assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management
options and operations concepts also were held.

The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:

¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest
said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has
identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended
and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed
to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable
capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified
Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing
systems such as the so-called ""Bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and Spacelab.

The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom
photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab
missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.

Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.
Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking
ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter
docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different
operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.

¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option
B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,
from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent
Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent
Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the
baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking
system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data
Management System.

Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree
inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration
orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic
arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.

Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss
segments and the U.S. lab.

Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two
orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.

Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other
section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and
propulsion systems.

The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete
state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,
a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete
the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.

Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware
would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived
option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including
program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and
operations costs, he said.

¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,
the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid
rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle
main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
and jettisoned after ET separation.

The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000
cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a
centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various
places on the circumference of the module to place the international
modules, and other elements.  This ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic
arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial
attitude.

In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor
said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so
that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the
Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.

Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space
experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members
of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space
Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. 
Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,
the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team
briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking
systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the
Soyuz TM spacecraft.

The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities
of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian
capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will
be available to the SRT through May 5.

Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT
subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to
develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a
foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various
management options have been developed including:

¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of
command.

¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate
Administrator.

¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located
hand-picked program office.

¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an
element of the current program.

¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and
geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.

The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the
Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had
already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its
preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.

As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency
experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of
assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing
and ground operations.

What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a
comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday
and Tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the
detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing
for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to
be held May 3.

Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the
Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the
activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant
deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve
as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to
consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request
from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.

Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being
carried on the schedule are:

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more
dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the 
activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot
faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is
not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective
clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,
you are likely to be less severely injured.

First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,
this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach
control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.

Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet
and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy 
piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking
boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine
for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay 
tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps
are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the
pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,
preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for
a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though
more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another
thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand
leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.

Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after 
drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement
and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions
are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding
in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, 
brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,
tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or
otherwise not in average shape.

With care, you should be ok.


I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.
Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If
you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as
low as a 300-400 cc bike.

Possible models: 
The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally
inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to 
weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier 
problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.

The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series
I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of
standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.

Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know
them as well.

For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to
buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective 
clothing and insurance and licensing costs.",tough question dangerous driving car far dangerous not apply modicum intelligence activity basically stupidity get hurtkille lot fast motorcycle car care not unreasonably dangerous also buy good protective clothing helpful way something go wrong likely less severely injure first thing possible take msf driver training course get start right foot teach control vehicle safe riding practice second buy protective gear minimum good helmet pair leather glove must good sturdy piece footgear also helpful though leather hiking boot pair old army boot something similar work fine purpose long make sure lace stay tied leather jacket leather pant chap nice well also expensive item pant many people consider good pair jean reasonable preferably recent fairly heavy weight similarly jacket good jean jacket reasonable compromise though people tend leather jacket around pant another thing drop garage sale look secondhand leather jacket look fairly thick leather item third not anything stupid not ride drink even one drink noticeably affect judgement balance not ride snow condition black ice likely careful ride rain slow way take corner gingerly brake early gently try not ride sick tired take medication drowsiness warning otherwise not average shape care ok would suggest mid late 80 japanese midsized standard something 400650 cc range would probably reasonable shorterlighter average might want go low 300400 cc bike possible model suzuki gs series eg gs500 gs650 etc generally inline 4 bike generally dependable except tendency weakness charge system stator andor regulatorrectifier problem first bike 82 gs650 server well honda nighthawk series may also know cb series think eg honda cb450 cb650 etc another series standard motorcycle also fairly dependable kawasaki yamaha probably similar bike not know well mid late 80 model able buy bike 2000 leave money protective clothing insurance licensing cost,1,rec.motorcycles

I like this statement, though for my own reasons.  Cost comparisons depend
a lot on whether the two options are similar, and *then* it becomes very
revealing to consider what their differences are.  Can Soyuz launch the
Long Exposure Facility?  Course not.  Will the Shuttle take my television 
relay to LEO by year's end?  Almost certainly not, but the Russians are
pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule.

Comparing S and SS points up that there are TWO active space
launcher-and-work-platform resources, with similarities and differences.
Where they are in direct competition, we may get to see some market
economics come into play.

Fine. I'll buy from George. GEORGEEE!!!!

That assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a
break on the launcher, I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works).  Only the
government pays higher-than-list price. 


Unless you're Martin Marietta, since (as I recall) they bought out the GD line
of aerospace products. 

If MM/GD does it as an in-house project, their costs would look much better
than buying at ""list price.""  Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built
in to the Titan?  C'mon. Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that... 


Oh please.  How much of a profit do you want?  Pulling $100-150 million after
all is said and done wouldn't be too shabby.  Not to mention the other goodies
I'll collect in:

	a)  Movie & TV rights (say $100-150 million conservatively)
	b)  Advertising       (""Look Mommie, they're drinking Coke!"")
	c)  Intangibles	      (Name recognization, experience & data 
				acculumated)


If you want lean, fine.  A $500 million prize would be more than adequate for a
prize.

Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider
a decent profit.

If you want R&D done, you'll have to write in R&D clauses.  I suppose you could
make it a SBIR set-aside :)

Given my desire to stay as far away as possible from farming and ranching
equipment, I really hate to jump into this thread.  I'm going to anyway,
but I really hate it.

Ed, exactly what kind of mutant horse-like entity do you ride, anyway?
Does countersteering work on the normal, garden-variety, one-necked horse?

Obmoto:  I was flipping through the March (I think) issue of Rider, and I
saw a small pseudo-ad for a book on hand signals appropriate to motorcycling.
It mentioned something about a signal for ""Your passenger is on fire.""  Any
body know the title and author of this book, and where I could get a copy?
This should not be understood as implying that I have grown sociable enough

I was assuming that there won't be a moon base unless it makes a

If I'm not mistaken, this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of
communications.  That timer is counting down continuously; if it ever hits
zero, that means Galileo hasn't heard from Earth in a suspiciously long
time and it may be Galileo's fault... so it's time to go into a fallback
mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances
of restoring contact.  I don't know exactly what-all Galileo does in such
a situation, but a common example is to switch receivers, on the theory
that maybe the one you're listening with has died.",not mistaken usual sort precaution loss communication timer counting continuously ever hit zero mean galileo not hear earth suspiciously long time may galileo fault time go fallback mode minimize chance spacecraft damage maximize chance restore contact not know exactly whatall galileo situation common example switch receiver theory maybe one listen die,2,sci.space

Yes, but that's because interstellar grains are very poor radiators, not
remotely black bodies.  As a consequence they are a lot warmer than the

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The ""large""
grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with
fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the
thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating
efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long
wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate
the energy they have absorbed.

Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100
microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer
wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In
the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable
by any conceivable observation.

Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a
population of ""small"" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50
atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to
temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool
quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_
the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small
population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed
""average"" temperature.

A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has
three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal
dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust
(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At
the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are
respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly
doubled in the ecliptic plane.

To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution
factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then
take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from
Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent
to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work
could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a
dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be
cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of
starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave
background, and I believe that to be correct.)

                         Dilution   Temp.   DT^4
Microwave background         1        2.7     53
Galactic dust              2E-5      25        8
Zodiacal dust (emission)   6E-8     280      369
Zodiacal dust (scattering) 3E-13   5500      275
Starlight                  1E-13   5500       92

                                             797

The fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K.  Outside the Solar system, the
result would be 3.5 K.  

I find these results surprising, especially the importance of
Zodiacal dust, but I don't see any serious mistakes.

I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like
Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char
they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the
right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars. 


If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a
time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are
running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the
cpu cannot work the whole time with one task. 

The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.


NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,
whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port
which has the UART on board.


I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied
with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

Ok, so you have proven you saw the right stuff.  However, as I said above,
it takes politics and PR to keep the bucks coming.
""No politics, no bucks, no buck rogers.""
 

Yes this may be true in the case of the SCIENCE data coming from the spacecraft
and other stuff about the operations.  However, there is still stuff regarding
regular operation that belongs to the company and they have ever legal right
to keeping it theirs.  But this does not mean that everything can or
should be swept under the umbrella of company proprietory data.
 

You can do the same here...you just have to wait a year.

"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this
time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:

[1] microgravity/vacuum process research
[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)
[3] spacecraft maintenence 

The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to
centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet
their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users 
took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to 
tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization
and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these
two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement
in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial 
users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the 
constellation.  

Firstly, different functions are broken down into different 
constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:
thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,
comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task
is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,
providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.

SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments
and are also prime candidates for constellization.

[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:
COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for
short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is
inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities 
on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab
to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.
We might also expand the research program to take advantage of 
interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt 
or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can
be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a 
station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.

[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,
but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation
environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter
of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since
astronauts will have little practical use in the space program
until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using
astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,
and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation
tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity
in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the
radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,
Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support
machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR
interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,
follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,
testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions
are spent on astronauts.

[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in 
Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated
robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can
practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck
solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,
inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be
spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat
companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.

By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting
rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we
have radically improved the capability of the program while
greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,
we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study
life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety 
of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum
research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose
orbits.

N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration
as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  
Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously 
we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used
to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and
sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can
be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology
greenhouses on Mars at low cost.

I disagree with what to tout, although I agree that the space program is
inherently a good thing.  Most people today only care about ""what will it
cost me?"" and ""what's in it for me?"" and could care less about whether
something is simply worthwhile in and of itself.  Our society has become
increasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as NOW!). 
They couldn't care less about next week, much less next century.  They want
something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*.

I think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that
are spinoffs of the space program.  That is the only way you can *prove*
its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too.  The continued
existence of the space program relies upon that money.

Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics.
And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at
8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically
designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen
IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times
it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When
you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it
at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,
none of them run at CPU speed.

The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to
a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to
get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.

My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but 
got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering 
the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO 
inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive 
of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out 
of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these 
rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) 



Anyway, here are my thoughts on this: 


I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch 
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, 
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  

To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that 
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.

"   >Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks
   >for sounding rockets?

   Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the
   tanks big enough.

Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a
telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for
steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie
during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much
continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also
need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and
flip the payload around to look at the Sun.

We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking
only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how
much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have
extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.

This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas 
quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you
in touch with our ground crew people.

Cheers,
Craig

   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.

much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.
That particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of
thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.

Once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do
something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road

just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications
are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA
they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).
Every new chip set confuses them.


I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and
it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to
fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If
you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file
P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the
P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,
you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right
combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy
of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT
file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices
should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.
You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of
the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,
too.)


The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my
knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the
Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the
numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing
with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the
8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use
benchmarks from ""unbiased"" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,
etc.



I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and
the results of anything else in the universe on these things.


Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has
hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's
use of a hardwired ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then
sat on a tack"" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in
real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the ""Bart
Simpson optimization,"" in which you save the bitmap of the
most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a
screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a
second time in a row.  (We call it the ""Bart Simpson optimization""
because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he
could right ""I will not cheat on benchmarks"" a hundred times and be
done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)


We don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.  There
used to be a lawyer in Montana who didn't, but he died.

"Hi,

    I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B,
and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.

    I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI
drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups
from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins
actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE
drive.

    I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to 
enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any
mention of it in the manuals.

 My system config is:
   i486DX/33 4Mb 
   Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI
   IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE

Another F2 rider had similiar problems, and this is the mail I sent him,
hope this helps resolve you problem!

Good point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things 
which come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.
The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let
suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the
vacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough
to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, 
since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, 
and as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. 

One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side 
panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the 
correct size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output
side of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make
sure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum 
to the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check 
for air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is
a vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it 
flows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in 
the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog 
or partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced 
to fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control
hose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.

Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there 
is something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, 
I would be typing all day to list them all! 

Here are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve
and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the
airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are
quite a few on each carb.

I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American
Honda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and
call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recall
it off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days

Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and
neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and
you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a
plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit
(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Are you sorry you asked yet?

I have tried others, but I think that the Adaptec is best value for money.




I dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of the
SCSI/IDE cards that is available.  You will have to turn your IDE off.




Instructions for drive type are included with the controller.  With some it may be
a type 1. no matter what the disk is.  With others it may be a type 47.  I had one
controller that I had to tell the BIOS that no hard disk was installed.

 


Do not low level format a SCSI unless you have the SCSI low level format program. 
First use fdisk to set the partitions, then use format.

Don't even get hyped up.  They are still accepting submissions from the

You don't seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of
v32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable
price), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster DSP chips, etc.)
to achieve its performance.

Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly
after that.

No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to
a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0
or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.
This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.

First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice
between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is
only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put
the dog first.

Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react
to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're
playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which
has hostile intent.

Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social
beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are
two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which
dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the
latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.
But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may
even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh
rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!

Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to
assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a
game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;
when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of
interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so
that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to
react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a
motorcycle is capable of.

With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures
may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important
-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the
road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up
newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will
hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is
that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The
larger the dog, the greater your anger.

Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he
are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he
is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.

Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory
where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are
satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped
punishment.",biker doglover first foremost want mention common sense choice injuringkille dog getting injuredkille one rational decision insane animal right kook would put dog first second useful learn read dog body language react dog chasing think game play completely different react dog hostile intent third useful learn present dog dog social beast recognize dominationsubmission hierarchy dog two type fellowcreature dominate dominate need unambiguously represent latter class god easily anger anger terrible god also amuse one properly submit dominance may even rare occasion dispense kind word kind word even oh joy oh rapture unforeseen dog bisquit relate bike well first good idea assume dog chase motorcycle think game not overt hostility msf suggestion good one see dog come slow determine particular place interception reach spot punch throttle reach already long go dog take second react new input definitely not comprehend acceleration motorcycle capable hostile dog one repeatedly encounter strong measure may necessary face first important make sure never face dog territory face road not driveway necessary large stick roll newspaper etc something beast understand something hurt stand ground slowly advance mental attitude angry go dispense terrible punishment large dog great anger dog pick anger pick fear since not home territory may suddenly dawn dog perhaps territory prepare fight death dog decide good idea retreat territory least home advantage also observe satisfied retreat gesture submission thus escape punishment,1,rec.motorcycles

Be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the
mirror.  It will depress the foam liner in the helmet.  That is not the
kind of foam that bounces back, like foam rubber.  Its purpose in life
is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin.
If your mirror compresses it, there is that much less energy absorbing
capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash.

I found the right handlebar to be a good spot, if on the sidestand.
Hang with the chinbar facing up, balanced across the grip and brake
lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the

No, the sky does not, at this time, belong to anyone.  Ownership is necessary
to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the
action was good or bad.  If neither you or I own a brick wall, then I can't
unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you don't
have the authority to declare that it is wrong.  The owner may find it artistic
or she may be call the police.

""maliciously"" implies evil intent.  The lighting companies aren't going out

How could this possibly be ""environmental vandalism"" when there is no
""environment"" to vandalize up there?

Since the advertising ""is just to help defray costs"", it's certainly no
surprise that ""the taxpayers would bear most of the expense"".  Sounds
like a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the
expense if they didn't do the advertising.


Great idea, they should have done it long ago.


I can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant
effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day,
but nobody complains about that.  Besides, it's in LEO, so it would only
be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if
it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky.


No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so
it would be no surprise.


Well, look on the, er, bright side.  Imagine the looks on the faces of
people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up
and see a can of Budweiser flying across the sky... :-D

"}Sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human,
}we have *all* the advantages.

I agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and
are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is
he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where
I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed
his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm
holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down)
and he can do nothing.

HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are
riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise
for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact
that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans
before you can dismount and deal with it properly.

By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention,
STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a
victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not
even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP,
and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, ""Oh, shit! This guy's serious!""
and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog,
and it probably will not bother you again.

Llamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama,
it will just hop on and insist on a ride. And that's if you're
lucky; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and
steal it!",sheesh even train attack dog match human advantage agree 100 grab chin careful keep hand away twist head go tailwag death even one occasion unexpectedly jump 130 lb german shepherd grab upper jaw one hand low jaw hold mouth open way strong enough clamp nothing however macho shit aside fact ride bike dog arrowe intercept may unwise stop try deal dog simple fact might leather work jean dismount deal properly mean kick dog otherwise get attention stop stay kick dog ride away victory dog drive territory not even qualified victory victory kick stop sit 99 dog say oh shit guy serious back establish dominance dog probably not bother llama however different story stop near llama hop insist ride lucky not like barf bike steal,1,rec.motorcycles

We can only say that they are beyond about 25 AU, due to the low
accuracy of position determination by single detectors.


It may be a NEW Physics problem (i.e. a problem involving new
physics).  However, the data is not good enough to rule out the >100
models which use old physics.  New physics is a big step, and is only
tolerated when there is no alternative.  For example , the Dark Matter
Problem (there's more to the universe than meets the eye) is a question
of comparable mystery to GRBs, but we have much better data regarding
it.  Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it,
but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an
experimentalist (or several) detects them in the lab.

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by 
shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This 
will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS 
settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, 
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of 
shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts 
power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is 
something like this on your board too. 

In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on 
""Setup"" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to ""
Always"" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over 
here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.

No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the
modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by
the modem.


Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other
hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport 
( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,
you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be
used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.

Subject: Logitech 2-button mouse pin-out & BIOS routine availability?
Distribution: world
Organization: Purdue University Engineering Computer Network

I have a Logitech 2S-2f (or 2f-2S) 2-button mouse that I want to
interface to a serial port of a different (non-ibm-compatible) system.
The mouse is XT/AT/PS2 compatible, with a DB25 connector.  I tried
to reverse engineer the mouse, but it has a micro-controller inside
it.

If I could get the DB25 pin-out, and perhaps a copy of the BIOS routines
that support it, I could map all this into my target system?

Anyone know where I might get the pin-out or the BIOS routines?
Are the routines published someplace convenient?

I've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...

My first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding
without any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the
turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!
Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering.

As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any
input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,
possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.

"   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler
back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled
Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you 
can't really communicate.

Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how
they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately
and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning
thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a
pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay
perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn
and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always
screws up the line I've picked out.

Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:
	- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.
	- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not
	  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount
	  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)
	- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)
	- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many
	  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)
	- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and
	  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're
	  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel
	  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  
	- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be 
	  gradual, so I can compensate.
	- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.
	- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right 
	  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how
	  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to
	  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to 
	  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, 
	  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, ""SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED"" 
	  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with 
	  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.
	  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the
	  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her
	  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to 
	  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)

Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, 
tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.
Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.

Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little
mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will
be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.
It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the 
first trip!

Trouble with that is, you then have no recourse if a mis-issued ticket

Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. 

As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was
a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They
said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low 
numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked
great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! 
It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  
I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those

"Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It
would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.
The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to
ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main
spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer
momentum to the ship.

  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion
heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave
into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are
going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,
helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic
radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission
products).

  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems
to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
they're there.

  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

  Thanks.

Hmmmm....  The prefix ""peri-"" is Greek, not Latin, so it's usually used
with the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited.  (That's why
it's ""perihelion"" rather than ""perisol"", ""perigee"" rather than ""periterr"",

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993
#1506

     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the
successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.

     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport
reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took
measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  

     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy
(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
Discovery.

     ""We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively
involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
important ways,"" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on
the balloon research campaign.  

     ""There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,"" he
continued.  ""The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,
and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own
right.""

     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the
mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. 
Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.

     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL
instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;
a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier
transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
atmosphere absorbs sunlight. 

     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-
hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130
kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground
stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.
Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded
to separate from the balloon.

     ""We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
measurements,"" Margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly in
darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""

     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the
completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward
their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS
scientists.    

     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon
Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a
contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was
launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction
and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.

     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than
one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic
meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with
helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh
between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The
scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds
and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.

     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper
Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements
Program.

The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers can't recognize

by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without
first removing that hand from the handlebar.  When you're

Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely

From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually
""idle"".  They will continue to service interrupts, etc.,
etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter
what it's doing.

I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use
circuitry which has more transistors than other
instructions, but if you consider the additional heat
generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors
and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's
packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate
environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be
negligible.

I don't think this will work.  Still the same in space
integration problems,  small modules, especially the Bus-1 modules.
the MOL would be bigger.   

Also,  budget problems  may end up stalling developemnt.  
A small undersized station wont have the science community support.


Program effeciencies may cut costs,  but the basic problems
with freedom remain.  in space integration,  too many flights
too build.  not enough science retrurn.  


Essentialy  $5 billion to build MIR.

I think had NASA  locked onto this design, back in 1984,  with
scarring to support a TRUSS for real expandability,  we'd be looking
at a flying space station.

This looks the most realistic, to me,  IMHO,  but,  i dont know if
there is enough will power  to toss the CDR'd  existing hardware
and then  take a 1/3rd  power cut  and do it this way.

the core  launch station has a lot of positive ideas.  You could stick
in more hatches for  experimental  concept modules.  Like the ET
derived workshops.  Or inflatable modules.

Fred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some
degree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done,
address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.

You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?
  [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between
   feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]

T

F

*** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***

I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently,
instead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.





I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not
least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is
and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last
point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective
point-of-view?

And, as usual, you defend your insults with ""he started it.""  ""Yeah, I
took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.""  ""So
what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.""  Besides that, I
think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it.
So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of
the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.

Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  ""I
never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you
gave it to me.""  Make up yer mind, Fred!





First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded
with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am
not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly
interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win,
can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that
between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of
your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.


*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***

Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you
would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason
to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations
that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more
meaning than they ever should have had.

My reading of what Nick actually said is that ""people aren't required in
all parts of all space processes"", so your taking issue with his opinions
regarding people in the space program, I read as ""People are required in
all parts of all space processes.""  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm
so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat
your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and
string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)

The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd
only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your
job, Fred.

And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,
simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'
that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that
you do as much as anyone.


No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made
you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though
it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as
dense as myself.





Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?


Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw
me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.
If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went
down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's
just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's
no worse than your own.

Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,
while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my
complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling
isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might
see it better, Fred.

""Net.ghod wannabe""?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my
motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as
your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about
people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to
impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private
mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a
jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.
Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and
bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable
purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried
to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to
communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.

Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job
with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,
I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't
have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nick
or Pat can approach your high standards, but I'm dropping it now.

DFW was designed with the STS in mind (which really mean very little).  Much of
their early PR material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three
others pulled up to gates.  I guess they were trying to stress how advanced the
airport was.

For Dallas types:  Imagine the fit Grapevine and Irving would be having if the
shuttle WAS landing at DFW. (For the rest, they are currently having some power
struggles between the airport and surrounding cities).",dfw design sts mind really mean little much early pr material scene shuttle land two three other pull gate guess try stress advanced airport dalla type imagine fit grapevine irving would shuttle land dfw rest currently power struggle airport surround city,2,sci.space

Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel
reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift
astronaut or something like that).  But yes, you've got the idea -- the
reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.


Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf
item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include
attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things
like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro
data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you
don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible
contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get
to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is
done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for
the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from
thrusters and the like).

The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the
reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well
suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing
a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was
relatively short, so it got cancelled.",actually reboost probably do last fuel reserve evas case chase adrift astronaut something like yes get idea reboost do take whole shuttle somebody build thruster module not offtheshelf item trivial piece hardware since include attitude control hst not strong enough compensate thing like thruster imbalance guidance provision feed gyro datum hst gyro external device separation not want leave attach afterward avoid possible contamination telescope lid open also get worry whether lid go open reboost do hst inaccessible shuttle lid stays closed duration prevent mirror contamination thruster like original plan use orbital maneuvering vehicle reboost omv plan sort small space tug well suit precisely sort job unfortunately cost lot develop list definitelyknown application relatively short got cancel,2,sci.space

I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install 
COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which 
write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call 
fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put 
""device=pf.sys"" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS 
tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and 
such also if that is of any value to you.",problem time ago bioses not automatically install com3 com4 port table program like modem program write directly port work fine anything use bio call fail find bbs ftp site get copy port finder put devicepfsy configsy run pfcom autoexecbat little program locate exist port make sure bio table update work great pf also let swap port also value,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

If we do, I think you'd loose.  Sure, you're hand's already on the
throttle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are
on the road!).

As is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure.

The answer is 161.33 feet.

: I also have a DX2/66 and a Maxtor 212. I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get
: 985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my
: transfer rate went to 830 KB/s. The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller
: transfer rate of 2.83 MB/s. I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface
: got me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to 

What is the deal with the IDE transfer rates?  Is anybody getting throughput
anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything
even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.  These drives are 1:1
(non-interleaved), aren't they?

Here are the rates I get:

1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector
                    blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec

2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly
                     so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec

3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec

I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter,
through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see
anything like ""after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host""
(even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent
quotes from the manual:

  ""Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
   3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.""  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec
   maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87
   sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)

  ""Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected
   'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of
   data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.""  (I take
   this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)

  ""For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer
   RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface
   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,
   while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers""
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the
requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess
you could call that a cache :-|).

So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a
measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr.
it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly
4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest
but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast
speed. I haven´t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.

"McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X

        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern
California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last
Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)
rocket ship.

        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in
mid-June.

        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for
SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60
million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a
follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies.

        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent
changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO
less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as
a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.

        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,
said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program. ""I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I
have available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell
Douglas Astronautics headquarters.

        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital
objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better,
faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead of
evolutionary technology developments.

        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test a
little"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said
the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --
showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of our
parents' time.""

        ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light hand
on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""

        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said
lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be
crucial. ""It's essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially.""

        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the direction
we're going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's
Democratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't
sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.""

        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.
Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,""
Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency.

        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell
Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Let's not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!""

         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.

        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its
C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures,
companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'
senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong government
investments.""

        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas
Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).

        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope""
of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The
first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle
take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to
5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000
feet.

        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final
tests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.

        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete""
Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.
Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles
aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated
check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.

        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will
become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the
Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of
thrust

        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on
throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround.

        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ
tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.
The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.",mcdonnell douglas roll dcx huntington beach calif pictureperfect southern california day mcdonnell douglas roll dcx rocket ship last saturday company hope singlestage rocket technology demonstrator first step towards singlestagetoorbit ssto rocket ship white conical vehicle schedule go white sand missile range new mexico week flight test start midjune although not cloud noonday sky forecast ssto research remain cloudy sdi organization pay 60 million dcx not afford fund full development followon vehicle get necessary hundred million require suborbital dcxa sdio pass tin cup among sister government agency sdio originally fund ssto research way cut cost orbital deployment spacebase sensor weapns however recent change sdi political marching order budget cut make ssto less priority today agency interested use dcx step towards lowcost reusable sound rocket sdio already do 50 briefing government agency say col simon pete worden sdio deputy technology worden decline say much agency would pony program not make colonel tell contractor much money available spend quip press conference mcdonnell douglas astronautic headquarters sdio lower sight program orbital objective agency official hail dcx example well fast cheap approach hardware development agency believe philosophy produce breakthrough leapfrog ahead evolutionary technology development worden say dcx illustrate build little test little approach produce result time within budget say program go concept hardware around 18 month show today engineer could move beyond miracle parent time key management worden say sdio light hand project one overwork major jess sponable although next phase may involve agency worden say lean management sense governmentindustry partnership crucial essential not end large management structure price go exponentially sdio approach also praise two california member house science space technology committee direction go go say rep george brown committee democratic chairman program stretch aout 10 15 year not sustainablenasa not learn yet sdio rep dana rohrbacher brown republican colleague go joke shrimp fish design nasa design team rohrbacher doubt program ever would complete leave civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district include mcdonnell dougla also criticize nasaair force work conventional multistaged rocket place new casing around old missile technology let not build fancy ammunition capsule top let build spaceship although rohrbacher praise sdio sponsorship say private sector need take lead develop ssto technology mcdonnell douglas face uncertain prospect c17 transport space station freedom program cautious large private secotro commitment large venture company put seed money say charle ordahl mcdonnell dougla senior vice president space system need strong government investment government industry continue differ funding dcxa agree continue incremental approach development cite corporate history liken process douglas aircraft dc aircraft two early aircraft pave way dc3 transport gradual evolution singlestage rocketry could eventually lead orbital delta clipper dc1 flight test summer white sand expand envelope performance successive test increase speed altitude first test reach 600 foot demonstrate hover verticle takeoff landing second series send unmanned dcx 5000 foot third final series take craft 20000 foot maneuver become complex third phase final test include pitchover manever rotate vehicle back bottomdown configuration soft fourlegged landing flight test series supervise charle pete conrad perform similar maneuver apollo 12 moon landing mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised vehicle aircraftlike approach operation feature include automate checkout access panel easy maintainance program move next stage engine technology become key consideration engine would thrust pratt whitney rl10a5 engine use dcx motor use liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen propellant generate 14760 pound thrust base engine use centaur upper stage a5 model thrust champer design sea level operation threetoon throttling capability also design repeat firing rapid turnaround worden say future singlestage rocket could employ tripropellant engine technology develop former soviet union result engine could burn dense hydrocarbon fuel takeoff switch liquid hydrogen high altitude,2,sci.space

"Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers
to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).

How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

Mark,

  47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained)
'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.
All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was
mint.

   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k
miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.
There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.
I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all
said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.

   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my
VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.
Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

"I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me.
But here is how i understand it.

At Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.
It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the
wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.

If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force
compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).

If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend
into,  then drag is reduced.

"My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,
then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it
didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my
house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to
the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to
the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to
harm.

But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the
roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph
for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the
left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he
had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,
heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I
saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took
the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was
driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent
marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think
I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this
moment is hazy.

I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The
apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut
mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my
shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.
So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!

Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never
moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike
off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some
gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me
here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.

What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have
prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not
necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was
riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if
it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the
thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a
blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are
long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?

I eagerly await comment.

I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus
ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton).  I caled
micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results.  I was
told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide
transfer speed.

I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem
as though it's cranking along at much more than that, but I also don't
know if I could tell the difference.

I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like)
and noticed no significant change in performance.

	New CARBS??? Why would that fix it? you still have to get the

You added a more free flowing exhaust, and then higher flowing filters. 
Chances are it's to lean. BUT! This may not be,that's the big fun with 
carb tuning. It's _very_ tricky. 

	Your one and only choice (unless you want to spend many hours
fiddling with the carbs) is to take it to a guy witha  Dyno and have he

I would follow the instructions, and just keep to city street riding for

If the clutch is in, then a large chunk of counter-rotating mass is not
rotating.  Hence, at a light, reving makes it twist.  Shaft effect is the
rear end rising under power or (the real problem) getting lower to the road
when the throttle is snapped shut (say when you are cornering and the heads
are real close to the road).  New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have
almost no shaft effect.



It's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the
extra light.  At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if
at all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need
to be at 4K RPM to get it.  


Full choke.  Open the gas taps.  Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the
throttle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.
My R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.

It's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard
to learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success
and failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the
battery while trying to get it to run.

If my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to
start.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to
vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.  I've got dual
plugs which make it easier to start.


The BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit.  It's good for a few MPG and the
parts are alcohol proof.  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof.  As
long as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is
nice since it helps keep ping away.  If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas
you ought to raise the compression! (Half a smiley, the BMW twins of the
80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy.  Dual plugs
and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance).",clutch large chunk counterrotate mass not rotate hence light reving make twist shaft effect rear end rise power real problem get low road throttle snap shut say corner head real close road new gs bike paralever shaft almost shaft effect question long spend low rpm much need extra light low rpm 3k not charge much alternator put sufficient wattage need 4k rpm get full choke open gas tap hit starter ever slightly blip throttle fire cranking do minimal throttle r100 like throttle raise bit idle experience thing like zen hard describe hard learn not pay atttention difference success failure especially get really pissed flatten battery try get run bike sitting week give short start not turn wait minute thing vaporize fuel system light right get dual plug make easy start big fix bing carb upgrade kit good mpg part alcohol proof part replace not alcohol proof long bike not go sit long period time gasohol nice since helps keep pe away bike not pe cheap gas ought raise compression half smiley bmw twin 80 beyond lowered compression keep epa happy dual plug high compression give back big chunk lose perfomance,1,rec.motorcycles

"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly
had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and
commercial space.  This is how it went...



After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,
I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty
Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard
the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.
Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.

We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,
who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not
bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to 
make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.

Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking
to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.
We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  
Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another
woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that
we brought up.

But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate
aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.
So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to
LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming 
feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.
We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism
paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the
atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog
over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is 
more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to 
understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education 
whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that
they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other
fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday 
would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.

We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business
angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal
communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided
in those sectors.

Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..
We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.

We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order
to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.

We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are
proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the
results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),
and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along
the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.

In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data 
Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.
He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,
and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually
happen immediatly there.

The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we
knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they
could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know
the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who
really did know the answers.

Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He
said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this
would be something that she would be very interested in, although they
do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the
state 1 week out of 6 these days.

What about positional uncertainties in S-L 1993e?   I assume we know where
and what Galileo is doing within a few meters.   But without the
HGA,  don't we have to have some pretty good ideas, of where to look
before imaging?  If the HGA was working,  they could slew around
in near real time (Less speed of light delay).  But when they were
imaging toutatis????  didn't someone have to get lucky on a guess to
find the first images?   

Also, I imagine S-L 1993e will be mostly a visual image.  so how will
that affect the other imaging missions.  with the LGA,  there is a real
tight allocation of bandwidth.   It may be premature to hope for answers,
but I thought i'd throw it on the floor.",positional uncertainty sl 1993e assume know galileo within meter without hga not pretty good idea look image hga work could slew around near real time less speed light delay image toutatis not someone get lucky guess find first image also imagine sl 1993e mostly visual image affect image mission lga real tight allocation bandwidth may premature hope answer think would throw floor,2,sci.space

I'm not sure if this is a big issue, but it seems to me like it
might be -- up till now, all >1g forces applied to the mirror and
its mounting (and nearly all =1g forces) have been applied along the
telescope's optical axis, and against the mirror's base.  Reentry
would apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull
the mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on-edge
forces to both the mirror and mount.  It could be that one or both
of these would not survive.

[On the issue of 'burning' nuclear wastes using particle beams...]



I sometimes wonder if your newsfeed gives you different articles than
everyone else, Pat.  Just a *few* corrections:

1) I never 'defended' 20kHz power, other than as something reasonable
to GO LOOK AT.

2) I have also never opposed a *research project* into feasibility of
the spalling reactor approach to 'cleaning' nuclear waste -- I simply
doubt it could be made to work in the Real World (tm), which ought to
become clear fairly quickly during a research program into feasibility
(sort of like what happened to 20 kHz power -- it proved to have a
down-side that was too expensive to overcome).

I figure 2 things wrong in a single sentence is a high enough fault
density for even you, Pat.

Ha!


Watch me. It flies. It lands. It gets rebuilt.



That's not what they told us back in the '70's.


1. It isn't a logical follow-on. A logical follow-on would have
been either a Russian ""snowfox"" type thingey (for the lifting bodies)
or something like MMI's Space Van (or Boeing's TSTO, or the airbreathing
TSTO the military is allegedly _using_ now that probably cost less
to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year).


Keep that attitude, and it'll be a couple centuries before we get real
access to space, unless another country without all that baggage comes
along and kicks our ass in the space race.


Or NASA HQ. That doesn't give the rest of the program plausible deniability
if we deceide that it wasn't worth the money we've spent, which is by now
probably a lot more than Apollo.


Yes, but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements.
You're saying basically that it met the engineering specs (which is
questionable, IMHO) so it's a success, never mind that you couldn't
get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in
a thousand years.


You can get hypersonic flight data with an X-15 or a follow-on X-15
type vehicle for much less.

And economics and engineering are interchangable; engineering in the
absense of economics is basically just physics, and in terms of physics,
the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X-15.



HS>Sorry, support that I can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers
HS>that I have some hope of riding some day.  At the moment, that's
HS>DC-X's hoped-for successors.


The shuttle program has a bad record. I _once_ had hopes for the
shuttle program. By now I know those hopes were false. 

All I have for DC-X and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles
are hopes. But at least I know they aren't false hopes yet.

I did support the shuttle, way back when. It didn't do nearly what
it was supposed to. It's time to move on to something that might do
the job of orbital delivery better. Or at all.





We don't want to learn how to operate on orbit. It launches, it
shoves out the payload, it lands. It doesn't waste payload hauling
up and down EDO pallets and the like.

The only thing to be learned from shuttle is how *not* to build a
launcher.

Finally: that bit about the ""proven"" shuttle. Are you hoping you can
tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it?


How much science and technology could have been done is the money spent
on shuttle had been spent differently?

...

Learn about economics and the current budget realities in the United States,
please.

I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science
Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail
proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to
generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at
the meeting. Here goes : 

			The Microlight Solar Sail
			-------------------------

1. Introduction
The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of
sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a
vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.

However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most
people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per
square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized
fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type
spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte
idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.

2.Design
Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a
tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely
be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control
methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a
panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.

The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at
Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data
gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and
communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface
of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of
the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.

3.Missions
The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:
a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor
groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit
rate.
b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved
areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to
reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive
sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that
volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these
locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar
base, BTW]
c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet
nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft
causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged
tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an
ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat
is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300
deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating
container.

When it's too windy to stand.

When you're on the road in high winds, stay alert.  Even more alert
than your ""alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill
you"" kind of alert.  Be aware of the terrain, and how it may funnel
wind in sudden gusts (well, not gusts to somebody standing there, but
it's gusty 'cause you ride through it).  If you are riding in a steady
crosswind, be aware of a hill that will block the wind, and adjust your
lean angle.  Be aware of passing trucks to your windward side, your
lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave
their turbulance cone.  Reducing your profile may help, ie, lean on the
gas tank and kiss the triple clamp.  Keep a nimble hand on the
steering, be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts.
Keep a larger than usual buffer zone, both ahead and behind, and to the
side, you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by
countersteering.  Keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror, if
someone is coming up wanting to pass, get out of their way early.  Stop
often for short brakes, extensive riding in high winds is both mentally
and physically fatiguing.

"Hello,

	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  
8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  
both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  
of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  
that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  
can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  
$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  
the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  
the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  
avoid...

So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  
well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  
$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  
do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  
extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  
ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  
probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly

(I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o) 


Now my comments: 

I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch

The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years.
See the discussion of ""high-power rocketry"" in the rec.models.rockets
frequently-asked-questions list.

This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need
proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-
power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend
the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.

You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under
one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not
especially hard to arrange.

As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled
properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty
air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with
model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which
eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.",situation regard change considerably recent year see discussion highpower rocketry recmodelsrocket frequentlyaskedquestion list not hardware walk street buy need proper certification mostly tripoli high power analog nar although nar cautiously move extend upper boundary consider proper need special faa authorization provide not one lax runway approach something stupid like not especially hard arrange model rocketry sort hardware reasonably safe handle properly proper handling take care need lot empty air fly basically model rocketry scale model rocketry highpower people use factorybuilt engine eliminate major safety hazard doityourself rocketry,2,sci.space

An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.

Owww.

Well, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...

I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started
riding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger
seats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't
even usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my
back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the
reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
a BMW. :)

I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains
or some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.

The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:

- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort
  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on 
  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop
  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.

- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider
  asks you to :)

- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements
  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,
  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.

- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably
  consistent shifting style).  Avoid ""helmet bonk.""  Helmet bonk is 
  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It
  gets old real fast.

- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands
  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,
  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.

- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be 
  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.

- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or
  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed 
  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.

"Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI

Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit

and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire
about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it
was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply
amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected
to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).

One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none

running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have

: > I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like. For example, is
: >there a constant sensation of falling? 

Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied:
: Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first,
: but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that
: of sky diving.

I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll
tell you about my first flight.

At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine
straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab
onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)
to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my
involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could
feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while
you have a cold).

At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,
since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment
going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of
gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay
attention to physiology at that time.

After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one
of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion
sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly
-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,
concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to
parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I
had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically
useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in
the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just
this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.
(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous
people who don't get sick on the thing.)

I didn't think of it as a ""constant sensation of falling"" so
much as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations
I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.

Jerry:
: >And what is the motion sickness
: >that some astronauts occasionally experience? 

Ron:
: It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be
: induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.
: Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more
: prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental
: part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is
: up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay
: pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is ""above"" the head of
: the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of
: motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to
: see how to keep the number of occurances down.

I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do,
among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one
called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on
a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual
aids.  The goal was to measure the victim's^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject's
responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated
exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness
symptoms.

      _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
      no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
      to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
      ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
      by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
      least it was a good try...

   So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?

I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)

   Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
   hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
   implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
   models.

Hmm, the ""superbowl"" burst has been claimed in press releases
to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I've read
(and I haven't seen the papers, only the press) I'd say it is
consistent with some of the merging NS models

   A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
   through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this

   Here is the abstract of that paper.

 ...
      indicator to these events all possible sources which are
      isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
      why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
      although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
      from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
      originate in the solar cometary cloud
      cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

Yes, this is a valid concern IMHO.  With the directly attached fan units I've
seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
suffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily.

My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's
located so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the
heat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air
flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise.  Essentially the 
arrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO.

Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of.
The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase
in animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the
Permian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals
rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread 
of humans.

(**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction

(*) about 800 families

Also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in
succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first,
ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory
when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms
(pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering
plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi
also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. 

(1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families)
(2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families)
(3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)

It's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number
of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this
in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that
diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions
happen often enough to keep the total number down.

(***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented
specific ecosystems were. 

See Cowen's book ""History of Life"" for a not-too-technical
run-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life.
Or see, Wilson's ""Diversity of Life"" for a view centered more
on current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biology
book of (what the hell, I'll say it) all time.

"Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.
Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want
to trade elsewhere.

Despite the fact that they answer the phone, ""Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're
having a GREAT Day!"", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return
a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.

The details:

I ordered one of their house brand ""Infotel"" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.
In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over
the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not
have ordered it, had I known this in advance.

It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was
preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.

For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the
time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.

Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or
14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After
spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested
disabling the COM2 port.

This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long
term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both
would not be in use at the same time as the modem.

I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail 
hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I 
was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they 
didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.

I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA
number. She promptly switched me to a ""Tech Support"" rep that implied that
it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA
number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I
was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.

Conclusion:

I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does
not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more 
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local
charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered
a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.",think buying midwest micro ohio think carefully unless absolutely sure not problem may want trade elsewhere despite fact answer phone hi whoever great day not quite happy want return modem not work expect detail order one house brand infotel 144df internal fax modem reality twincom lightning fax paper sticker name give poor report net modem would not order known advance arrive time documentation state would work preconfigured com4 provide com2 not use time several reason serial card configure com1com2 time instal modem nothing connect com2 although modem appear work every connection 9600 144 would randomly break connection hang phone spending time phone midwest tech support suggest disable com2 port appear solve disconnect problem unacceptable long term solution com1 2 available even though would not use time modem call back 20 minute prior closing wait voicemail hell listen repeat advertisement midw micro product promptly disconnect apparently quit time not want bothered caller wait line call next day ask customer diservice agent rma number promptly switch tech support rep imply equipment fault not go give rma number suggest use nonstandard irq setting solution not happy modem work originally configure conclusion not sure modem would work ok basic system clearly not work multi port system like mine since time worth aggravation cost modem give local charitable organization description problem order practical peripheral 144mt pc connection,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Indeed so; it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible.  It is
possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there
is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced
by the Earth's rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of
the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator
where it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest-
without-oxygen feasible.  Only just feasible, mind you:  the guys who did
it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation,

If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.


The truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly
from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a
row and keep the lower results. Don't just turn interrupts off, it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices.

Here is an example of how to do this:

/* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */

/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port
 * directly.
 * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.
 * Will timeout when 'int count=0' counts up to zero.
 * This sample reads one port (A is presented and B is in the comments).
 * You can read both at once by merging the two, but it will time out
 * when either joystick is not connected.
 *
 * There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as
 * the joystick circuitry needs.

Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a
total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch.
Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period
of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and
all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"".
There is also a ""High Power Safety Code"" which designates more
specific rules such as launch field size, etc.

Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket 
motors you need to certified through either the National Association
of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures
require a demonstarted handling and ""safe"" flight at a total impulse
level.

"I have a '72 CL350 which I stopped riding about 2 years ago (I upgraded
to an '84 Sabre 750).  I parked it in the corner of my parking lot, and planned
on draining the gas, spraying oil in the tank, etc. to get it ready to store.
Well, after a lot of procrastination, all I ended up doing was throwing a 
tarp on it.

Well, now I have to move and want to clean up the 350.  I tried starting it
(with someone else's battery) and had no luck.  My first guess is that it is
the gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (I can only
pray that I didn't trash the carbeurators).  The question is, what do I do
with this old gas?  I am not going to run it in my Sabre, and I think that
there is enough that I don't want to burn it (campus police don't think

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.
With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while disk
operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.

So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it
possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes, with no DMA.",way multitaske computer actually give cpu power io overlap io overlap cpu continue think disk operation underway whereas without overlap cpu sit idly wait disk operation finish disk operation take eternity compare fast cpu got multitaske want increase performance increase amount overlap one way dma bus master either make possible io device move datum memory without interrupt cpu alternative cpu move datum several scsi interface card allow dma bus mastering ide however define standard interface create ibm pc require cpu move datum byte dma,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

1. do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the
   executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer.  These are
   available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
   fee.

2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also
   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right!

3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
   pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1
   on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok
   but assumptions are bad).

4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct,
   then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.

The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in
gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and
stall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that
I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time
needed to put the bike in gear.

So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second
evasive manuvers.  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line.
(Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can't
split (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the
lane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next
car has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure
it will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to
stop, I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit
of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to
tell if they are planning to brake or not!

So in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your
mirrors until it's all clear.",experience describe not like sit bike gear figure chance startle way stall bike figure likely chance unable escape situation extra time need put bike gear concentrate avoid situation rather make splitsecond evasive manuver split lane not end line unfortunately not legal country not split perhaps not room stop near one side lane easy escape leave bike gear next car stop watch mirror mean time make sure whether really would time move car fail stop not find yet car annoying habbit racing behind brake heavilly hard tell planning brake not summary position easy exit watch mirror clear,1,rec.motorcycles

By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)

Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use
the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system
try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or 
crash.(I forget)

Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are
16-bit.

The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.

I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.

In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.

I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA.
I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.

I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the
same DMA channel.",initiate dma xfer seriously busmastere adapter dma ability not use motherboard onboard dmawhich much slow isa bus arbitration two busmastering card 1 isa system try dma xfer dma channel system lock crashi forget 8 dma channel isa system 07 03 8bit 47 16bit system use dma 0 soundblaster use dma 1 could buy busmastere xga2 video card busmastering scsi ha order work properly would find dma channel xga2 card use simply configure scsi ha use different dma channel dma xfer not know multiple dma xfer go time isa not sure eisa system either know eisamca system allow bm card use dma channel,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'.

There several reasons for this :-

When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be
busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted.

When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out.

In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!

May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well...

" 

My fiancee' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up.  I'll tell you 
what we've found and the systems we've worked out.

- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider
to judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something
and leaning forward.  Remember this.

- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally 
this means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned
over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.
Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous.

- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough 
for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding 
onto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast
because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which 
shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.

- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not 
out wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.

- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.
Normally this means ""slow down, and do it now!"".  



We only have a couple signals.  ""Slow down"" is her either tapping me on 
the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency
of the matter :-)

""Turn here"" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is
also the sign for ""cool!  Look at that.""  ""I hafta pee"" is the same sign
as ""turn here"".  ""I'm hungry"" is the same sign.  ""Go faster"" is usually
done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see ""slow
down"" more often than ""go faster"".
 

The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and 
pillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're 
in almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because
you as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely
feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes
at any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  
Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.

Also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up
than by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and
""in the Zen of the moment"" less.  Remember this.

	You'll likely not notice her weight too much.  A piece of advice
for you:  don't be abrupt with the throttle.  No wheelies, accelerate a
wee bit more slowly than usual.  Consciously worry about spitting her off
the back.  It's as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers,
and I guarantee she'll be put off by the bike ripping out from under her
when you whack it open.  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time
out too.  You and her need to learn each other's body English.  She needs
to learn what your idea is about how to take the turn, and you need to
learn her idea of ""shit!  Don't crash now!"" so you don't work at cross
purposes while leaned over.  You can work up to more aggressive riding over
time.

when you brake--this could save you some severely crushed cookies.

""Get the organization to act on it"" is easy to say, but says little
about what one really can and should do.  What the organization
actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors,
as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an
election of officers.

It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in
the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C

that already are in politics?

You and the Beav should lighten up (esp the Beav).  I agree that
DUI/DWI is serious.  We should have reasonable laws, strict
enforcement, and tough sentences.  But, Andrew did not
post ""looking for sympathy over the consequences.""  He posted
asking for advice because he had an extremely high quote.  His
post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for LESS.
He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in
any way drunk driving (and has renounced drunk driving).  There
are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other BDC.
Why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem
an outcast?  He has paid his debt to society.  Step off the high
horse.  We have all been irresponsible in the past.

With that said, I'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards
rapists.  I think it comes because I feel the punishment is not
severe enough.  The same may be true of DWI/DUI. If that is the
case, then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to change.  If 
we had a reasonable law about DWI/DUI with a stiff penalty
then fewer people would do it.  

At any rate, Andrew as paid his debt as defined by the law.
If you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates, 
tell your 'representatives'.

"I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to
Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation
Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done
some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original
announcement.) 

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is
the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training
of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe
design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.
Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,
Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.

I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at
MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an
F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening
experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year
or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to
see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines
for future space craft use.

If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would
be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty
have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the
receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they
are rapidly changing!

                         The Dream Machines:
An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature

                            By Ron Miller
                  with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke

Krieger Publishing Company
Melbourne, Florida, USA
Orig. Ed. 1993
Pre-publication $84.50
ISBN 0-89464-039-9


This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the
tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make
such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to
reach them.   

Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,
attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel
became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that
matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason
as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate
reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and
knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as
well as selected events important in developing the idea of
extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological
entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between
simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal
connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every
entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every
spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This
allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize
differences, similarities, and influences.

This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,
and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The
unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
very interesting history of the spaceship.

SPECIAL FEATURES

Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and
fictional

Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos
contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare
illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and
drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and
obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA
archives

An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!

V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two. 

How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at
130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mb/s.

[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!

only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)
As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort (let alone anything else)

  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.

  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume. 

  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that...

Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT,
that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk
controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format
program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from
debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it ""knows"" about.
Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you
can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a
third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like.

IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug
it in and go to FDISK.

Thanks for the information!

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri-
helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about
2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU.
If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet
ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's --
which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could
get under Jupiter's influence.


Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the
1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.
Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well?

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the
spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available, or you need to retrain a new team.

Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.
Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA 
series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.
Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a ""standby"" mode for
use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap.

Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time.

In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.",also remember every dollar spend keep one spacecraft safe mode probably spinstabilize sunpointe orientation dollar not spend mission analysis new spacecraft order turn spacecraft back either need insure op guy available need retrain new team say spacecraft propose many operational satellite goddard fly like tiro noaa series require one satellite orbit operational set extra get replace onorbit power standby mode use emergency case however op team still require fly operational bird standby maintenance relatively cheap finally pat explanation spacecraft require continuous maintenance stay control also right mark suggest spin stabilize control mode would require little power maintenance still might require momentum dump time time end political decision since difference money technical rationale behind decision,2,sci.space

it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on  
the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the  
adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the  
quantum?

2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.
Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and  
all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.

3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type  
of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.

4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I  
think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with  
SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual  
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want  
the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?

Depends. If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC, on billion
$$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the
moon. If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the
transfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. Either way, its a lot
more than needed.

This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO, but it is
enough to do it if the vehicle exists.

Great speculation - I remember being proud on behalf of all the free
world (you think that way when you are seven years old) that we had
got there first. Now I'm almost sorry that it worked out that way.

I guess the soviets would have taken the victory seriously too, and
would almost certainly not have fallen victim to the complacency that
overtook the US program. Perhaps stretching to match US efforts would
have destabilized them sooner than it did in fact - and in the tradition
of Marvel Comics 'What If', this destabilization in the Brezhnev era might
have triggered the third world war. Hmm, maybe it was a giant leap after all.

+The Shuttle was never proposed and Skylab never built.

HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT

    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA
    announcement.

    Q. How do I become an astronaut?

    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably
    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying
    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have
    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to
    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet
    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you
    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission
    specialist"".

    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,
    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,
    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough
    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,
    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.

    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands
    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer
    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-
    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in
    another seems to be a frequent winner.

    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a
    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows
    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term
    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other
    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,
    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.

    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in
    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying
    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you
    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you
    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is
    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and
    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.
    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,
    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.
    Keep your nose clean.

    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;
    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.

    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,
    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were
    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).
    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job
    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you
    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".

    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance
    to demonstrate motivation.

    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.

    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center
    Houston, Texas

    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates
    ==================================================================

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ---------------------------

    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for
    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates
    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a
    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.

    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be
    considered.

    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in
    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation
    program.

    Space Shuttle Program Description
    ---------------------------------

    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated
    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming
    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in
    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then
    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and
    flight crew.

    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment
    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation
    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials
    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will
    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space
    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher
    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space
    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include
    government agencies and private industries.

    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,
    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are
    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA
    astronauts.

    Pilot Astronaut

    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.
    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,
    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the
    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the
    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing
    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other
    payload operations.

    Mission Specialist Astronaut

    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,
    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations
    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and
    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to
    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed
    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and
    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the
    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission
    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling
    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific
    experimental operations.

    Astronaut Candidate Program

    Citizenship Requirements

    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of
    the United States.

    Note on Academic Requirements

    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic
    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --
    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum
    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's
    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,
    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.

      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the
    sciences, are not considered qualifying:
      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,
	Medical Technology, etc.)
      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological
	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).
      - Degrees in Nursing.
      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)

    Application Procedures
    ----------------------

    Civilian

    The application package may be obtained by writing to:

	NASA Johnson Space Center
	Astronaut Selection Office
	ATTN: AHX
	Houston, TX 77058

    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA
    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be
    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is
    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and
    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually
    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate
    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants
    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from
    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the
    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be
    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as
    supervisors and references may be contacted.

    Active Duty Military

    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their
    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application
    procedures will be disseminated by each service.

    Selection
    ---------

    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required
    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.
    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered
    will be notified of the outcome of the process.

    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the
    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following
    their establishment.

    General Program Requirements

    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be
    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,
    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and
    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or
    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to
    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut
    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills
    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot
    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during
    their candidate period.

    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does
    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut
    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and
    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the
    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become
    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for
    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not
    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA
    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that
    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a
    specified tour of duty.

    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified
    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.
    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.

    Pay and Benefits
    ----------------

    Civilians

    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal
    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,
    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements
    and experience.

    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and
    participation in group health and life insurance plans.

    Military

    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center
    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and
    other similar military matters.

  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS
that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power
burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also
had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a 
bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear
in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was 
NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of ""slip"" device in the shaft
to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!

  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane
do a ""stoppy""(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike 
up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these
activities anymore (now that I'm an ""old guy"" with kids of my own) but
it looked damn impressive!!

: <BOOM!>  Whooooooooshhhhhh......  <sputter, sputter>

: <okay, PRETEND it would make a sound!>
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just a thought... (let's pretend it IS INFLATED and PRESSURIZED) wouldn't
there be a large static electricity build up around the puncture?
If the metalization is behind a clear sandwich (ie. insulated) then the 
deflating balloon would generate electrical interference - ""noise""

By the way, any serious high velocity impact would simply cut a ""Bugs
Bunny"" hole through the wall, highly unlikely to ""BOOM"", and the fabric
would almost certainly be ripstop.

Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. Yet we still consider it
payload. Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to LEO roughly the
same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years.


They where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound. A resurected
Saturn would cost only $2,000 per pound (if development costs are ignored)
which is five times cheaper than Shuttle.

Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for
about two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:

     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have
       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the
       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I
       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my
       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your
       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright
       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)

     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually
       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give
       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.

     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors
       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see
       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out
       of the way *now!*

     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I
       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from
       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).
       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice
       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.

Now, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line
that I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape
route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that
you don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line
(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up 
next to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided
that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.
Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind
you?

"

According to this reasoning there are no rights, at least none that I can think 
of....

Let's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority
drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.

Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning.
I could go on with these examples for a long time....

Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks,
and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized, 
imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be
free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was 
good for them.

I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority,
is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in
his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all
common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay
my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government
taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.
This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people 
by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have
equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and
medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of
beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered
night sky a right.

Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people?
The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail
than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.

Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution
you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole
life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see
squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live
for?  

I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both.
I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.
That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.

"Hiya 

I'm a VERY amuture astronomer in Adelaide Australia, and today, I heard some
very interesting and exciting news from a local program on TV. As I couldn't
find anything on it on the news server, I have posted this. However, if it is
old information, tell me, and ill sue the TV station for saying they are 
'Up to date' ;-)

(Also, my news server could be slow. . so . . .!!!

I only caught the end of the article, so all the information on the topic
is not known to me at the moment.

The news is of a small 'psudo' planet outside the orbit of pluto found in a 
Hawiian obsevatory, supposably 'recently' - acording to the report.
It was meant to be about 150miles in diamater, and a faily large distance 
from the plutos orbit.  (it had a computer drawing, and the orbit distance
from pluto was about the same as neptune to pluto when they are furthest

rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to
distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made
ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines
with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A ""D""
engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.
An ""F"" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a
doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size ""O"" are
available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are
shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of
size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as
controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket
engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)

the eastern US rather than the whole continent.)  Given that those were

    It is certainly possible, and quite easy in most cases, especially
on two-strokes.  It's very common to do this on bikes where the
cylinder-mounting through-studs don't prevent the cylinder from being
removed with the engine in the frame.
    I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian, which was
easier yet because it does not have through-studs.  Base flange studs,
and separate head bolts, dontchaknow.
    You have to use a little foresight, rags, duct tape, etc. to keep
clips from falling in, clothespins, hoseclamps, etc. to support the
cylinder while you're inserting the pins.

	I am puzzled by the term ""concept."" Drag free may already have
been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would
more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and
ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball
floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little
adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would
then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity
anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously
adjusting its position to compensate for drag.

Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just
tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying
to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to
go the 'right' way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those
sackcloth and ashes?

[I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are
not surprised, though.]


Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it
sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was ""sounds almost like
perpetual motion"", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different
propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should
beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?


I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
(relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs,
technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible
and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable
approach? 

And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with
something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
with and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces, pounds,
or tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of
material and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,
weeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a

There are two 'problems':
(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit
    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the
    meantime, and
(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So
    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by
    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to
    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.
My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the
clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero
value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS
about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS
calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other DOS call.",stuff delete two problem 1 bio tod routine update bio clock use 1 bit day increment second wrapping clock past midnight get lose one call bio read clock meantime 2 bio reset day wrap indicator first get date call anybody wrap indicator set unless first bio get date call midnight do do kernel part do know increment date day wrap indication normally lose guess kevin amenu system use bio call read clock order display time hence entity cause day wrap indication get lose even amenu system notice day wrap think indicate nonzero value al really not particularly good way tell do dos update day menu system ishould use do call get time would cause do kernel bio call wrap indicator would hence process properly possibly though amenu system not easily use do call time do not reentrant perhaps time incremente ofter occur amenu system inside do call,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)
at approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34
meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM
yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days.

As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to

referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico
did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a
commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of
dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic
advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space
to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the
traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick
non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for
launch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with
the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm,

to plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer

": I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one
: I already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable
: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors
: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, 
: the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable
: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But
: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
: in the cable to align these.  

Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed
circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your
IDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in
the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle
is center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide
positioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:
look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On
all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin
is pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard
for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins
39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep
the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the
cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the
pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But
beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables
with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors
this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide
which side is pin 1.

: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the ""master"" drive
: and which into the ""Slave""?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives
are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you
should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the
drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper
selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the 
docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,
then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have
one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like
yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't
have convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice
help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be
able to help you).

Things could be worse. A lot worse! In the mid-eighties the
teen/adult sci-fi comic 2000AD (Fleetway) produced a short story
featuring the award winning character ""Judge Dredd"". The story
focussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered
multi-coloured lasers/search lights pointed at the moon to paint
images on the moon. Needless to say, this use hacked off a load of lovers,
romantics and werewolfs/crazies. The ad guys got chopped, the service
discontinued. A cautionary tale indeed!

"I have a 1974 Honda CB360T which for most of my purposes runs well. 
However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. 
That is, on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th I'm lucky if I can
hold speed.  If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops
drastically.  Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000
rpm.  The top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  Standing still
the engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K).

Other phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the
engine becomes a little wavery.  That is, at a steady throttle the
engine speed goes up and down slightly.  The bike has about 13000 miles
on it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk.

I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. 
My thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.  I'm
hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth
the hassle of any major engine work.

"Some time ago I sent the following message:
   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony.  I'm gearing up to
   do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move
   onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have
   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,

   How many people do you want to share the colony with?
 

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  


   Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave
   from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young
   enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.

I didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.
Thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.




Here's the (edited) responses I got:


   How many people do you want to share the colony with?
 
100

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  

Cylinder 200m diameter x 1 km long

Rui Sousa
ruca@saber-si.pt

=============================================================================


100,000 - 250,000


100 square kms surface, divided into city, towns, villages and
countryside.  Must have lakes, rivers amd mountains.

=============================================================================

1000.  1000 people really isn't that large a number;
everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year, and will probably
be sick of everyone else within another year.


Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the
percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there
were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.
And everyone, especially me, likes to ""go exploring""...I would want to be able
to go for a walk and see something different each time...

=============================================================================

For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enough
to have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town
""everybody knows everything"" syndrome, which some people like but
I don't.  Call it several thousand people.

For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough
to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time
getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough
for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that
5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

My desires, for permanent move to a space colony, assuming easy communication
and travel:

Size:  About a small-town size, say 9 sq. km.  'Course, bigger is better :-)
Population:  about 100/sq km or less.  So, ~1000 for 9sqkm.  Less is
better for elbow room, more for interest and sanity, so say max 3000, min 300.

I think you're both right.  Teflon was actually discovered by accident
before WWII.  From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it
was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.
Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.

The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say
the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  What the space
program did was to find a way to get it to stick.  Thus we had no-stick
frypans on the market in the late '60s.

No, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  Indeed, this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the array-flapping problems.

The retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would
involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not
to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot
of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination.",thing design retrievable pinch indeed dictate rather odd design solar array since retractable well extendable may thus indirectly contribute arrayflappe problem retrieval problem exactly state would costly would involve extensive downtime worry someone find reason not relaunch would unnecessarily expose telescope lot mechanical stress possibilitie contamination,2,sci.space

The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes.
This means that unlike the Germans (who do great things all by themselves)
the Japanese tie up with foreign companies. The major one is Mitsubishi
(who else) who have a sharing agreement with GE I think. No chance of a
new design.


Sodium has *lots* of chemical problems. Like it eats stainless steel. Very
slowly but it gets there in the end. Not what I call a desired property.
As for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? It is a bitch and
it is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it
gets used. Two loops? That's not a design problem? Isolation from air and
water? That doesn't cause design problems? In comparison BWR's a dream rides!

Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the
controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and
it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.

The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU
for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really
does stink.",stuff delete actually make reasonable amount sense fix disk sector buffer controller transfer memory arep insw whatever instruction call quite efficient single instruction go fast controllercpu know use bus since 286 not cache bus likely critical resource relative cpu performance possible dma bus interference would cause much loss cpu cycle compute arep insw sequence floppy hand not buffer use cpu floppy datum transfer do pc jr way really stink,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

configuration, with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna; uplink
at 125 bps, downlink at the 2 K Engineering data rate.

was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at 10:30 AM.

Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to

activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due
to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.

"It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis
joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my
hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than
a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick.

I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. 
I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works
quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear
and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or
down in features.

For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here
compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra
$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.

Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle
Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,
down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into

You may want to save yourself the trouble and go to Radio Shack.  They have
a null modem adapter which is a 9 pin connector that swaps the necessary

soldering the connections yourself, and usually a bit more reliable.

        To the North Pole!

        On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON 
    rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan 
    Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe 
    for the planet Venus. 

        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing
    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the
    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic
    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core
    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of
    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by
    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels
    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large
    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The
    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger 
    to properly transmit this information to Earth. 

        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed
    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)
    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a
    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by 
    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'
    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). 

        The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over
    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects 
    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the
    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations 
    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the 
    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern
    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or 
    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially 
    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.

        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 
    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, 
    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a 
    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around 
    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA 
    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus' 
    first polar-circling spacecraft.

        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 
    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north
    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers 
    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  
    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over 
    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back 
    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took 
    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions 
    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers 
    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.

        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more
    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, 
    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, 
    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the 
    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean 
    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the 
    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids 
    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) 
    across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.

        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists
    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes' 
    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the 
    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest 
    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American 
    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell 
    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern ""continent"" of Ishtar Terra.  

        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about
    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later
    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar
    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-
    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be 
    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan 
    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even 
    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet 
    probes maintained that distinction.

        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted
    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the 
    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's
    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about
    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few
    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating 
    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds 
    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) 
    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty 
    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees 
    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.

        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were 
    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at 
    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to 
    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control
    gas to perform the operation.  

        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving 
    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six 
    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an 
    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.

        Venus by Balloon

        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting 
    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of 
    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of 
    the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)
    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint 
    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, 
    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.

        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, 
    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full 
    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe 
    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.

        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named
    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei
    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft 
    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one 
    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  

        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to 
    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.
    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from
    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists 
    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such 
    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  

        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar 
    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall 
    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice 
    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar 
    encounter.

        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and
    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not
    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a
    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical
    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the 
    comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and 
    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. 

        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet
    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel
    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget
    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to
    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of 
    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter 
    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor 
    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.

        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building
    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify
    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an 
    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,
    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of 
    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the 
    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. 
    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the 
    location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive 
    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.

        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA
    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander
    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the
    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers
    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released
    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)
    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had
    successfully arrived. 

        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was
    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a
    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen
    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as
    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat
    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment
    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,
    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for
    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special
    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which
    permeated the planet's atmosphere. 

        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just
    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag 
    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened 
    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  
    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as 
    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  
    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar 
    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists 
    had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight 
    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.

        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day
    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600
    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did
    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer
    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers
    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three
    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the
    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers
    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and
    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the
    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius
    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.
    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. 

        Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already
    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with
    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 
    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the
    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the
    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen
    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to 
    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 
    miles) above the surface. 

        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before
    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not
    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of
    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never 
    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature 
    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees 
    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's 
    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background 
    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.

        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and 
    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data
    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The
    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, 
    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active 
    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.
    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air
    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)
    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.

        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks 
    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.
    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results
    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers 
    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were 
    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 
    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a
    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), 
    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-
    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air 
    over the last seven years.

        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last 
    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on
    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around
    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March
    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the 
    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.
    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial
    bodies with one space vessel.

        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for
    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2
    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking
    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning
    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)
    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still
    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.
    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent 
    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-
    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the ""continent"" of Aphrodite 
    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 
    miles) towards the surface.

        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air 
    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius 
    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1
    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed 
    through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning
    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer 
    failed to function.

        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite
    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900
    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother
    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a
    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in
    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, 
    rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in 
    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree 
    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured 
    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,
    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.

        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at
    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin 
    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 
    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet 
    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers 
    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three 
    hours.

        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley
    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the 
    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-
    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance 
    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets 
    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly 
    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was 
    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  
    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.

        Future Plans Diverted

        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous 
    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second 
    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for
    the early 1990s.

        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple 
    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft 
    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon 
    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's 
    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over 
    the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to 
    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible 
    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main 
    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.

        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in
    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA
    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet
    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space 
    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction 
    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this 
    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next 
    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on
    Mars' largest moon, Phobos. 

        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,
    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and 
    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.
    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious
    consideration of human colonization in the near future.

        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars
    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,
    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other
    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon
    landing in March of 1989. 

        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to
    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the
    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put 
    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have
    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of
    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. 

        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change
    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began 
    to ""open up"" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with 
    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the 
    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking 
    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a ""free market"".

        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.
    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making
    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring
    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to 
    make money.  

        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for 
    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price 
    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary 
    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United 
    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.

        MAGELLAN and GALILEO 

        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration
    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.
    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of
    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most 
    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When
    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be
    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108
    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.

        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space 
    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit 
    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle 
    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, 
    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the 
    probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.

        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on
    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around
    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach
    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary
    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the
    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in
    that violent atmosphere.

        On the Drawing Boards

        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,
    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-
    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet 
    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, 
    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions 
    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also
    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.

        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects 
    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes
    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected
    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing
    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air
    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed
    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air
    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.
    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.

        Humans on Venus      

        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?
    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure
    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something
    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into
    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like
    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking
    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide 
    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability 
    to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster
    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries
    if not millennia.

        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand
    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how
    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became
    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?
    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found
    through international cooperation, including the nation which 
    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE

    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM

    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,
    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version
    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)
    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE
    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly
    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or
    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming
    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.

    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news
    frequently.


    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?

    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).

    The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,

	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is
	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower
	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)
	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other
	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort
	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of
	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target
	in second stage.""

    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try
    to interpret.

    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.

    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the
	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line
	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly
	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of
	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z
	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""
	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the
	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.

    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more
	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or
	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").

    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver
	complexity"").

    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio
	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio
	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").

    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a
	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.

    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east
	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:
	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.
	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.

    This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
    achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers
    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main
    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime
    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is
    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""
    [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The
    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the
    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle
    guy.)

    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll
    maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw
    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total
    maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math
    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element
    array.


    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT

    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite
    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72
    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed
    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from
    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.
    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
    for these viewers.

    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.
    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.

    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is
    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press
    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle
    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying
    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions
    are not being covered.


    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS

    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:

	W6FXN  - Los Angeles
	K6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California
	WA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.
	W5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas
	W6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.

	W6VIO	 224.04		 21.280  14.282  7.165	3.840
	W1AW		 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290	3.990

    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the
    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.

    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. No mission audio but they
    transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 UTC.

    Frequencies in the 10-20m bands require USB and frequencies in the 40
    and 80m bands LSB. Use FM for the VHF frequencies.

If I may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you
love vehicles or the use they are put to. I, myself, think the F-86 is
a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn't even think of flying
it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
on how they perform.


Not to this degree.


Why?


Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has
the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle
isn't reusable, it's salvagable).


The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X
shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.


The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available
thrust and still land safely.


Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same
thing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.


You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You
wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
harmful side effects would you?


You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it
will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do
need to do to build SSTO.


Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.


Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will
carry passengers.


I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original
schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.


Your ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being
unreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for
opponents of manned space to kill it.


The only way to prove those things is to build it.

Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting
ready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out
of town (in NM).

As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work
on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have
some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital
prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for
another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with
major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a
set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.

Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of
this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next
year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.

Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made
for spending half on DC.

Public support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I'll
help you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media
ans get them to cover the flight tests.

Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to
(usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No
motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call
failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use
""slower"" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that
slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.

Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster RAM.  

Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus 
slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

   Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will
automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high
IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. 
   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1
on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of
the interrupts in between. Works just great.
   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that
details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the
higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.

  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the 

first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- 
especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no
problems.

   My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
   known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked
   that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
   set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code
   and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew

I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons
that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of
reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds).

(And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way
back when it was only on sci.space).

For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus
would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit
of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the
part of proponents.

Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been
levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light
pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the
target area.

You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites.
I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that
SPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied
opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types.

#2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested
recently.  While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that
any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of
these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be
concerned, and something any project like that would work against
anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's
going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much
dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find
many activists in Murmansk demanding the ""natural"" sky back. If anything,
he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp,
making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the ""day.""

The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass
advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of
those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't
have lived without before. And I doubt anyone's going to really be
able to convince them to stop.

                        ( ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION )

               ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) 

               A very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the 
          FACT of ""BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS"" (reactions like Mg + O 
          --> Ca, Si + C --> Ca, K + H --> Ca, N2 --> CO, etc.), as 
          described in the BOOK ""Biological Transmutations"" by Louis 
          Kervran, [1972 Edition is BEST.], and in Chapter 17 of the 
          book ""THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS"" by Peter Tompkins and 
          Christopher Bird, 1973: 

               (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same 
                   kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.]

               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight 
                   and number.

               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks.

               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.

               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]

               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier 
                   mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, 
                   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]

          
               BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our 
          own bodies. 
          
               Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with 
          carbon, such as ""horsetail"" extract, or radishes) can SPEED 
          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-
          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, 
          oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. 
          
               The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms, 
          cause ""STONE SICKNESS"" in statues, building bricks, etc..  
          
               The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron, 
          creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators 
          and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). 
          
               Some bacteria can even NEUTRALIZE RADIOACTIVITY! 
          

               ALL OF THESE THINGS AND MORE HAPPEN, IN SPITE OF the 
          currently accepted ""laws"" of physics, (including the law 
          which says that atomic fusion requires EXTREMELY HIGH

Being related to former trainers, I have come to know that humans do have all the
advantages (well, at least one anyway). It is a little known fact that a dog will
involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. I
was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and
force it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become
momentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
have our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's
disorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a 
choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like
the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
pissed.

If your distance calc is correct for an ""on the road distance"" (and not
as the crow flies), this is 900km a day for 5 days.  If you spend the
entire time on interstates, which would be a total waste of time, that's
at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating/peeing/
sight-seeing etc.

I was contemplating a similar trip, but from Ottawa to LA, or
maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx.  

I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it, I'd
have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of
time enjoying the country around me; i.e. stopping with a camera,
meeting towns-people, going to a few bars.  No sense spending 2 weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump.

I estimated I'd need at least 4-5 weeks to make the trip worthwhile.

Try and stay off the interstates!!!


Depending on your route and my plans, I may be heading that way as far
as at least Detroit.

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a
three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the
earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible"". The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration.

	This from an issue of 'Science News' or 'The Planetary Report' I
believe, about 2 months ago(?).

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.
However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint
ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far
as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within
a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the
center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can
always hide a sufficiently small number of a different
type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming
that there is only one population of GRBs).

The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center
of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center
of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets
way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing
GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to
be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models
tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.

If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)
you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of
the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center
(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they
are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in
radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda
Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the
Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.


The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't
see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.


There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.

This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing
layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.
Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or
delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years
following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have
a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.

Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and
other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the
comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously
degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of
""parking your lid"" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the
comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly
damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.",cb not stupid leave helmet seat cb fall go boom ryan another good place helmet mirror kid not bad advice helmet two major impact absorb layer hard outer shell closedcell foam impact layer helmet lose protective property inner liner compact time long outer shell damage delaminate age dr hurt test helmet many year follow landmark study estimate helmet lose 80 effectiveness inner liner compression video produce discuss phenomenon detail puncture compression type cause mirror sissy bar relatively sharp object bad offender even comfort liner unaffected dent hole foam seriously degrade effectiveness helmet habit parking lid mirror suggest look comfort liner condition foam significantly damage missing replace helmet,1,rec.motorcycles

I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your post, but DRAM *does not* have to
be refreshed on *each access cycle*.  So cycle time does *not* have to be
twice the access time *because of refresh phase*.

The access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw
address strobe (RAS) to data bus driven.

DRAM access cycle timing chart can be roughly shown as following (some
signals are intentionally omitted);

ADDR --<RA><CA>-------<RA><CA>--------- RA=Raw Address, CA=Column Address
RAS  ~~~~\________/~~~~~\________/~~~~~		~=High, _=Low, -=Floating
CAS  ~~~~~~~\_______/~~~~~~\_______/~~~		<..>=driven either H or L
DATA ---------<VALID>--------<VALID>---

         |-+--|  |
           |     +----------- cycle time
           +---- access time (or RAS access time)

Yes, the cycle time is more than twice as the access time but *not*
because of the refresh phase.  The refresh can be done either as a
trailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle.

Spring break, I went through the four corners area and back.  The most
beautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook.  Though this
is a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highly
recommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It
was not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was
heading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I
should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation
area.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may
have been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is
about 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles
overlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably
maintained (I ran it about 70mph).

Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on 
the world.  If it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it.

That's a twin-cam, right?  There's a steel guard right next to
the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the
engine cases, and it's needed.  There's probably not enough room
to fit a bigger sprocket.

I'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5% ratio
change rather than adding one to the front for about 7%.  If you
raise the overall gear ratio too much you'll impair the bike's
rideability, because the gears will be far enough apart that
there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at
any given speed.  Honda 750s don't have the widest of power
bands.

   If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a
   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,
   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than
   just a ""we have the money, why not?"" approach.

Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills
to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding
high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to
fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European
cooperation.

Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of
money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as
investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at
the size of that multiplier :->).",turn moonbase good ought not post hundred odd post go would think real reason moon base economic since someone space industry presumeably much large gnp would without space industry eventually simply able afford stuff read right say essence large economy nation discretionary fund waste lunar facility certainly partially case apollo real lunar colony probably require continue military scientific commercial reason rather money not approach ah whole point money spend lunar base not waste moon not like would use 1000 1000r bill fuel moondozer money fund lunar base would spend country base belong way funding hightech research like darpa good excuse fund various field research pretense crucial defense country like esprit good excuse ec fund research pretense good paneuropean cooperation maybe think governmentfunde research waste money fact pretty sure count investment spending boost economy look size multiplier,2,sci.space

I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
have the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.

Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay
for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don't like
it, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a
floating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.  It's the same 
reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.

George.

	It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry.
If ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include
a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government
here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental
civil rights.

I say: 
	Any reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show
	you that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice,
	discrimination, and violence against others of different
	races, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.

If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation
to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected
in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you
know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,
they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent
you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.
In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.

I say:
What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,
would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating
at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and
would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
aesthetic values that make us human.  This includes the need for wild
and unspoiled things, including the night sky.

Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the ""figure includes a
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers""  This is sloppy people and DUMB.

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list:
SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s
 asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.

SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit
 hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1
 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
 {Range 0-5MB/s}

One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by
people.  Its PROPER meaning is ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of
SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:
(My comments in {})

PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,
{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE...""
{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}
To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers 
are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the 
operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions
were going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off hand
and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was 
asked about that very matter: ""Why can't we spend a few million more
to keep instruments that we already have in place going?""

His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and
the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc
is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using
current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have
very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure
in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,
however starting a few years after he had retired he would become
one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not
funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just
as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it
to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new
missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before
the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.

Pretty depressing reading. I think a good lock and some common sense about
where and when you park your bike is the only answer. I've spent all my
spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of
my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in
relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to
manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway, since the weekend there are only two
bikes :( and no, he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock, it was too much
hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8
weeks (if they don't decide to investigate) for the insurance company
to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin.

Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US
but very common in the UK. The UK distributor, given in the above article
is:
	Michael Brandon Ltd,
	15/17 Oliver Crescent,
	Hawick,

The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required.

Not to flame (REALLY), but thats an abominable viewpoint (while were
on the subject of abominations).  If we followed the ""redistiribution
of wealth"" (and by the way, ist that what Clinto and the Democrats are
trying to do...), EVERYONE would starve in short order.  Not only is
it impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every
(wo)man's altruism (can you say black market under communisim
anyone?), but the current methods of resource production are entirely
energy dependant.  There are not enough sources of cheap capital
(aside from human capital) to allow us to stop looking at space a an
excellent source of materials and realestate.  More directly, perhaps
you mioght consider the fact that BILLIONS are spent by TV companies,
and their sponsors, (ABC, NBC, CBS...) on the SUPERBOWL, the OLYMPICS,
and even on monday night baseball games.  Perhaps we should boycott
those games?  If DC-X and company get finished, and there is a market
for it, those ""abominable"" space will probably be much more cost
effective for the companies, and those starving children.  More people
buy products, the company hires more workers, end result fewer
children die of starvation.

"I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations
rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is
utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to
BATSE press releases.
The idea behind the statement is as follows: 
     ""if you smack two neutron
      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,
      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a
      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy 
      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes
      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.
      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must
      be wrong.""
As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who
was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It
may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray
burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created
may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding 
medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may
carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All
this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,
Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.
It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one
around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative
proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the 
so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which
a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black
hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter
will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal
force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the
black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,
which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such
events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,
but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate
of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two
scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less
in the failed supernova scenario.

On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must 
ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method
such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,
or finding a definitive signature of some known class of
objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists
have historically not been too successfull in finding the
distance of any object by proving that there is only one
possible way in which the object can work, and therefore
it *must* be so-and-so.",feel compel complain statement recent observation rule merge neutron star source gammaray burst utterly false even though popular enough make batse press release idea behind statement follow smack two neutron star together neutron star gobble black hole lot energy release enough gammaray burst cosmological distance reasoning continue energy release lot matter radiation become thermalized expect see roughly blackbody spectrum observe spectra strongly nonthermal model must wrong often fault lie imagination person try prove model wrong rather model may initial energy release not see gammaray burst fireball energy matter create may spew relativistic flow slam surround medium strong flux nonthermal gamma ray result may carry substantial fraction initial total energy not idea series paper martin ree peter meszaro sorry miss accent coworker certainly not complete model may well good one around sum propose distance scale alternative proposal create initial fireball way socalle fail supernovae scenario stan woosley massive star end life collapse black hole stellar core rotate part infalle matter temporarily halt support centrifugal force form dense neutron torus accrete onto black hole beast may spew jet along rotation axis constitute relativistic flow rate event may much high neutron star merger flux may strongly beam net rate burst observe earth stay two scenario energy release per event lot less fail supernova scenario another note believe distance scale must ultimately resolve via classical astronomical method finding counterpart burst wavelength find definitive signature know class object distribution position flux theorist historically not successfull find distance object prove one possible way object work therefore must soandso,2,sci.space

Hi!

Yesterday, while on Lonoak Rd, a wasp hit my faceshield with just
enough force to glue it between my eyes, but not enough to kill it as

I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.

No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come

I'll vote for anything where they don't feel constrained to use stupid
and ugly PC phrases to replace words like 'manned'.  If they think
they need to do that, they're more than likely engaging in 'politics
and public relations as usual' rather than seriously wanting to
actually get into space.  So that eliminates Option ""A"" from the
running.  What do they call a manned station in Option ""C""?

[I'm actually about half serious about that.  People should be more
concerned with grammatical correctness and actually getting a working
station than they are with 'Political Correctness' of terminology.]

"Fellow netters,

I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has
one.  I have my eye on two choices.

software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software
Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.

Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169
mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.

I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ($149).  

Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the
best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices.  Which should I buy?

If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would

     Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this older
stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)

     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be
compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  

    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on
the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read 
either :     62-000042-015 or
             62-000094-0x2

     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.


    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.


    Looks right.
  
[art deleted]


      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have
the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:

              5 + +    open
              6 + +    open             
              7 + +    open        
              8 + +    open
              4 + +    closed
              3 + +    closed
              2 + +    open
              1 + +    open

    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.
Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8
select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the
second drive (drive 1).   

      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have
to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.


      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not
right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables
are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   
     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few
times and banged my head for a day.....


     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:
       
        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)
   
    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.


      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's
just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).

If you are using a TWISTED 34-way cable then move the jumper 
on your drive to the neighbouring pins   :8::::::.  Make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) - the
coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.

This may also help.

          NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS 
          contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.  
          When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will 
          not ""boot.""  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips 
          must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital  
          XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 
          or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT 
          controller you are using).

          NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, 
          WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in 
          Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or 
          ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) 
          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or 
          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the 
          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then 
          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the 
          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 
          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION 
          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY 
          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the 
          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must 
          be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the 
          interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

     HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR SCSI HARD DISK DRIVES
     
          
          7000-ASC - A SCSI host adapter that serves as an interface 
          between the AT bus and the SCSI bus.  All necessary drivers and 
          receivers are included, permitting direct cable connections to 
          the SCSI bus through a 50 pin connector and to the AT bus 
          through two edge connectors.  The 7000-ASC utilizes jumper  
          configurable options that enable the address space, DMA channels 
          and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end user's 
          application.  The board also features word data transfer at 4 
          megabytes per second (synchronous), an on-board floppy disk 
          controller and a ROM BIOS.  Please note that the 7000-ASC 
          operates using standard DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3 only.
          
          7000-FASST2 - This SCSI host adapter card provides the same 
          features as the 7000-ASC plus additional support capabilities 
          using software developed by Columbia Data Products.  The 7000-
          FASST2 will support MS-DOS 3.2-3.3, Compaq DOS 3.31, PC-DOS 4.0, 
          PC-MOS/386 version 2.1, XENIX, Microsoft Windows, Novell and 
          Sytos tape backup.
          
          WDATXT-FASST KIT - An ""unintelligent"" SCSI host adapter that is 
          compatible with the IBM XT, AT and compatible systems.  It uses 
          a 50 pin external SCSI bus ""D"" connector with a standard 50 pin 
          internal SCSI cable.  The WDATXT-FASST can be used as  both a 
          target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for 
          SCSI designers.  It also provides a low cost alternative for end-
          users desiring to install a SCSI peripheral device such as a 
          hard disk drive or a tape backup unit. The kit includes an 8-bit 
          SCSI HBA board, manual, FASST software diskettes and an internal 
          SCSI cable.
          
          SYTOS TAPE BACKUP - (Utility for 7000-FASST) - FASST-SYTOS - 
          FASST version of Sytos tape backup utilities.  MS-DOS 
          compatible, it runs with FASST software products Revision 3.3+.
          
          
     HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR PS/2 MODEL 50, 60, 80 SYSTEMS  
     (MICROCHANNEL ARCHITECTURE)
     
          
          WD1006V-MC1, feature F300R - Hard disk controller with an 
          ST506/ST412 interface for microchannel systems.  It supports 2 
          MFM drives with up to 16 heads and 2048 cylinders, 1:1 
          interleave and faster data transfer due to ""look ahead 
          caching.""  The""V"" boards can run in high speed AT systems (10 to 
          16 megahertz system speed).
          
     
                                       -8-


          
          WD1007V-MC1, feature F300R - This controller card will support 
          up to 2 ESDI hard disk drives, 15 megabit per second transfer 
          rate and it contains a ROM BIOS with ""shadow RAM"" that will 
          enable the controller card to interface with all types of ESDI 
          hard disk drives without modifying the system BIOS.  It uses 1:1 
          interleave.  The ""V"" boards can run in high speed AT systems, 
          (10 to 12 megahertz bus speed).
          
          
     
     CONTROLLERS FOR FLOPPY DISK DRIVES ONLY
     
          
          WD1002A-FOX - Half-slot floppy disk controller for XT or AT 
          systems.  Four versions of the board are available:
                Feature F001 supports two floppy disk drives.
                Feature F002 supports four floppy disk drives and includes 
                an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector and 
                an optional 4-pin power connector.
                Feature F003 supports two floppy disk drives and includes 
                a ROM BIOS that will enable your system to recognize     
                floppy disk drives that may not be supported by your AT 
                system ROM BIOS.  The optional ROM BIOS will also allow 
                this controller card to operate high density floppy disk
                drives in an XT system.
                Feature F004 supports four floppy disk drives and includes 
                an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector, an 
                optional 4-pin power connector and a ROM BIOS that will 
                enable your system to recognize floppy disk drives that 
                may not be supported by your AT system ROM BIOS.  The 
                optional ROM BIOS will also allow this controller card to 
                operate high density floppy disk drives in an XT system.

This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding
of what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's
atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive
answer is ""photosynthesis"", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis
by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced
is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed
is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of
the resulting reduced material.

On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic
matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires
continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow
that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).

This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without
continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating
an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a
hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.

There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere
has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least
2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to
weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback
mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak
anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen
level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about
it.",good question major blind spot understanding make earth habitable example earth atmosphere concentration oxygen naive answer photosynthesis clearly incomplete photosynthesis not make atmosphere oxygenate oxygen produce consume plant decay eat need photosynthesis plus mechanism sequester fraction result reduce material earth mechanism burial seafloor sediment organic matter mostly oceanic source however burial require continental sediment deep ocean burial rate slow material consume sequester suggest planet without large ocean planet without continent undergo weather hard time accumulate oxygen atmosphere particular allocean planet may hard time support oxygen atmosphere also problem oxygen earth atmosphere relatively stable geological time period least 2 order magnitude long decay time atmospheric o2 weathering absence replenishment convincing feedback mechanism identify perhaps reason weak anthropic principle last 500 myr oxygen level drop low not wonder,2,sci.space

Indeed, the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully
enough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a
bit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon's fat
""Communications Satellite Handbook"" has a graph of sky temperature vs.
wavelength, in fact, for communications design.

However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible.
For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky
looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, ""Astrophysical Quantities"").
I haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation
tends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says ""about 4K""

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-
and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.
The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.
But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.
  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,
and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask
me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I
can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by
existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and
we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries
will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to
start them, etc.

Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy
does have a 9ms average seek time. I.E it finds data 25% faster than my 12ms
Toshiba drive.


I don't think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus :-(


890KB/s is pretty good...


Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the
art IDE drives. Only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520MB Fijitsu
drive for an example!


I use an Adaptec 1542B on my Unix box and no-name IDE cards on both.


Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does 
not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost,
and you don't want to clip off the panels each time.

For the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that
there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks,
etc.) used for deployment.  This was partially so that everything could
be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially for
safety considerations.  (I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile

they weren't even carrying extra suits.

So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS?  That's the critical question.
My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant.  Of that, a 
substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry
burn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going
mass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested.  After
you show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1
and extra equipment is going to cost.  




First, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was
because they _had_ to.  They don't like to do that as a general rule.

Second, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying
to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that.  
Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.

Third, they don't have eight months.  They have however much time is left 
after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved.
You may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it's realistic.  I'm not
saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).  
What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
management.



""All they have to do is soup it up?""  Just what does that mean?  




The second servicing mission is a contingency.  You have neither shown that it
would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your
plan.  


No, Pat, I haven't forgotten.


No Pat.  That's $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost
of the extra struff you want to bring along, minus development and mangement 
costs, minus extra operating costs.  TANSTAAFL.



I'm sure that if you reread this you'll see that your argument is falacious.


Pat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's _made_ to 
perform this task, it also ignores the point.  There is a desire to have 
astronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done
about it.  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door,
you haven't solved the problem.

   This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
   anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
   as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right
energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation
with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting
all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of
baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a
plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating
enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it
happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to
make tight-binaries of neutron stars.

Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a
neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but
that uses pretty far-out physics.

My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so
GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't
rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which
converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black
holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets
aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which
modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these
mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the ""Tunguska Meteorite""
was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely
to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet
collisions matches the GRB rate well.

The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort
cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them
out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the
right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible
to match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the
wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-
cloud GRB's at all.",not propose mechanism grb oort antimatter annihilation not fit spectra least far understand annihilation spectra big difference ignore question fit distribution oort distribution oort distribution not well know particular comet aphelion not well known not good measure oort cloud distribution merging neutron star least mechanism right energy except not explain apparent correlation galaxy galaxy structure mechanism get energy gamma ray significant amount baryon around lot pair production make plasma thermalize energy trouble generate enough energy explain powerful burst 105253 ergs happen fast compare burst duration hard make tightbinarie neutron star another cosmological mechinism catalytic conversion neutron star strange star merger two strange star use pretty farout physics point not good mechanism distance grb likely happen unknown mechanism not rule oort cloud would spectrum event convert comet strange matter spectra primordial black hole eat comet antimatter comet collide matter comet not quite right perhaps unusual mechanism modifie spectrum energy match well mechanism accord trevor week tunguska meteorite miniblack hole collision earth likely enough miniblack hole around rate bhcomet collision match grb rate well fact not know distribution comet oort cloud not reason rule make hard rule point cite paper assume get right distribution oort cloud hard not impossible match distribution grb get wrong distribution oort cloud not constrain oort cloud grb,2,sci.space
"After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have
a couple of questions I hope you can answer:

When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill
cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used to
the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean
and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike
is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do
I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without
screwing it down before reading?

The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on
the head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do
you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?

My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter
replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?

If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether
anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near
future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.


You'd almost certainly use air.  Given that you have to pressurize with
*something*, safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable
(even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing,
to avoid needing a ventilation system, it's nice if the hangar atmosphere
is breathable in a pinch -- it makes mask functioning much less critical).",largescale satellite servicing able pressurize hangar make considerable sense question whether anyone go largescale satellite servicing near future point justify development thing would almost certainly use air give pressurize something safety consideration strongly suggest make breathable even service crew use oxygen mask normal breathing avoid need ventilation system nice hangar atmosphere breathable pinch make mask function much less critical,2,sci.space

  The larger cable seems to be a much better unit.

  I've got the larger cable - about 5/8"" inch in diameter (actually, I think
its larger), about 4 feet long which coils into a 8 or 9 inch coil, with the
tubular key lock like the U-locks.  It has worked fine for me for two years
now, and *seems* (to me, anyway) that it is very secure.  It doesn't have the
weaknesses that the U-locks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick

"Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  
The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the
Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns
have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically
located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,
and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)
from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the
office he works for is an administrative convenience.

I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.
At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,
but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),

The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber
about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).
The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several
hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston
is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens
of atmospheres.

The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until
a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.
The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch
bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they
intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel
could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to
move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used
in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter
and about 50 cm long.

All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen
gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the
barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a
sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The
plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped
in the barrel ahead of the projectile.  

The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic
water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic
projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,
the projectile vaporizes.

The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is
about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km
if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun
to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can
fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB
to follow the projectiles.

The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4
km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,
and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test
they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it
had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but
I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).

There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this
gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=
4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.

This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically
a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-
sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of
100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg
useful payload to orbit.

Anyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length

reach 50,000 feet.

"}I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
}This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
}(read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
}fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

Unless she is really adventurous, do NOT take her on this route for her
first extended ride! That's kinda like taking someone on a no-show 10-way
speed star competition as their first skydive.

}This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much
}of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go?
}I want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and
}I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
}turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional

1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer
setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.

2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:

a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP
sign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the
pegs until you tell her to get off the bike.

b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough
that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And
(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as
possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your
balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.

c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't
lean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.
Don't look over your shoulder.*

3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That
means don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than
usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have
the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,
so be prepared for that.

4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't
have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.

5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things
of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get
so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives
her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.

* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended ""look over the rider's
shoulder in curves"" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of
her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,
unlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the
pillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain
perpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone
else on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.",need advice someone ride pillion 750 ninja first time take anyone extended ride read far around block ride twisty fairly bumpy road mine roadmthamilton loop sf bay arean unless really adventurous not take route first extended ride kinda like take someone noshow 10way speed star competition first skydive person 100 lb fairly small not see weight much problem sort advice give go want hold onto rather grab rail back hear look shoulder direction turn lean else traditional 1 ninja adjustable suspension adjust stiff set not bottom bumpy curve 2 tell 3 cardinal rule never ever ever ever put foot not stop stop sign not think gon na crash never keep peg tell get bike b hold onto waist hold tightly enough not slide bike twist throttle bit add bonus keep close butt possible quick stop not make slide knock ball onto gas tank decide good word c stay perpendicular bike straight seat not lean body curve go bike stay perpendicular not look shoulder 3 remember time passenger back mean not pop clutch try corner stop smooth usual aware jump brake go equivalent 100 lb dead weight crash behind prepare 4 make sure piss ride even say not go antiwoman stuff tiny bladder 5 remind look around ride point thing interest make ride enjoyable not get focused look back helmet give ample excuse squeeze show see pointed wife try msfrecommende look rider shoulder curve bit not work time weight shift unpredictable especially maxim unlike ninja upright riding position really restrict pillion view road ahead next time remain perpendicular bike could hardly tell someone else bike curve weigh substantially 100 lb,1,rec.motorcycles
"[...]

Aw, c'mon.  The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,
not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.
The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.

I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.
The first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.
This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I
contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that
the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,
dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate
flair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually
that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and
boring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)

The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has
a few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and 
tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly
identify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's
personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.
(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads
to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.
Finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my
big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which
actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter
to my use and flamage in general.

In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may
be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
applicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a
flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your 
motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone
who looks like you, too.

I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in
that essentially says ""If you never hear from Earth again,
here's what to do.""  This was a back up in the event a receiver
burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but
still some data).  

Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for
startup, if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe, it might
not be such a big loss.  Obviously you can't plan for
everything, but the most obvious things can be considered.

It is kind of absurd, isn't it?  Some players even want more distortion,

Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most 
instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more 
performance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.
The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 
2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of 
the slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose
to but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...
Anyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,
which is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario 
slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full 
throttle.

Just remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or
exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may
have to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust
system, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point
which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping
profile.

Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if
they have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the
system also to see what they think about there slip on.

Also, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a
group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a 
side bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at

"Help!  I've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle.  This is great!
Unfortunately, she needs at most a 28"" seat.  This is not great.  So far,
the only thing we've found was an old and unhappy-looking KZ440.

So, it's time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there.
Anybody know of models (old models and used bikes are not a problem)
with a 28"" or lower seat?  And, since she has to make this difficult ( 8-) ),
she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser.  So there's bonus points
for listing tiny standards.

I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through
several months ago.  Did anybody keep that list?

Thanks!

My best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under ""Motorcycle Dealers"") and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club.  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details.  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
afford it.  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  Apparently.

"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a
single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3
scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is 
currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale 
experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.

On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled 
""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University of
Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and
determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is
not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with 
them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used 
the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details
of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope
they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will
be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.

The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The
main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that
this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I
did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters
and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in 
mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson
showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:
                  ______
3 G         /|   /      |
           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly 
          /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines
2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are
        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as
       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.
1 G   /                 |
                        |
                        |
0 G                     |

             ^          ^
           ~100 sec    ~400 sec


As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below
3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the
accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are 
throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it
soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in 
accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines
bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut
out entirely.

The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed
for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of
air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to 
that desired.

Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)

Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than
    all at once?

A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.

Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?

A:  Can't tell us.  ""Read Aviation Leak.""  He also apparently had a good 
    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  

My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting
national security or MD protecting their own interests?

The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch
up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and 
the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs
of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,
and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.
The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have
about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 
60 degrees south latitude.

I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that
aspect of the flight profile.

I think I can. Largely as a result of efforts by people reading this group
writing letters and making phone calls the following has happened:

1. NASA reprogrammed funds to keep NASP alive in 1991.
2. Efforts to kill DC-X and the SSRT progam where twice twarted

3. Gouldin kept his job in spite of heavy lobbying against him.

"Hi Netters!

I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about
my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:

1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).
    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both 
    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / 
    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5"" and 5.25"" floppies.

2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).

From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these 
options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees 
any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking 
(I don't know very much about these beasts):

1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.
    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?
    What do the floppies themselves cost?


2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a
    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any
    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?
 

3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)


4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or 
    recommendations for manufacturers?

Back in January and February there were several articles (Wash Post, Time...)
saying that NASA was ""considering"" the option just as it is now ""considering""
a followup mission 6-12 months after the servicing mission.  However, the
down time was estimated to be a year+ (servicing, checkout, sceheduling
and training another shuttle, orbit verification...) and to be quite
expensive.  I think it may have been more a mental exercise than a
real plan.  Don't know.

"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's
LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to
stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by
saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense
of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station
miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" -
the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the
romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of
matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with
its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things
people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I
think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of
nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind
children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but
I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about
what we can do *now*.   

Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...


SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW

Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)

At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a
midlife crisis.

The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no
longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion
-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic
rewards.  

Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science
and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a
meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our
technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion
policy.  

To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies
for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes
would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of
scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.

.....

Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to
write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively
supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion
to build space station Freedom alone.

Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,
Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken
public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much
of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope
to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively
implemented did not seem to matter much.

Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent
vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar
space budgets.

Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo
era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration
with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  

......

While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel
Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being
positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's
technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been
slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions
its competitiveness agenda.

   Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The
   chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
   dominance in the marketplace.

   Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced

No... you can do this? Really? The other morning I went to do a lane change
on the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far
enough behind. I looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in same
position, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decide
I have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating. I travel about 1/4 mile
staying ~200
feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and I do a casual mirror check. This
guy is RIGHT on my tail, I mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire &
his fender. I keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off teh
throttle. He stays there until I had lost about 15mph and then comes around
me and cuts me off big time. I follow him for about 10 miles and finally
get bored and turn back into work. 

I can file a complaint about this? And actually have the chance to have
something done? How? Who? Where?

"Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working
and had made it first.  They could have beaten us if either:

* Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,

and/or

* A Saturn V went boom.

If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone
head and done some landings, but we also would have been more
determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the
Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend
upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base
would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think
that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would
have concentrated on the moon.

"ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56

(Flight V.56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS-601 series 
Galaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)

The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE 
satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with 
inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km.
This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L 
configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched
from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French 
Guiana.

The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg
of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass
at liftoff is 361,778 kg.


Required Orbit Characteristics:
  Perigee Altitude ..... 200 km
  Apogee Altitude ...... 36,160 km at injection 
  Inclination ..........   5 degrees


The Ariane 42L lift-off for Flight 56 is scheduled on Thursday,
April 29, 1993, as soon as possible within the following launch 
window:

LAUNCH VEHICLE:

Ariane 42L.  This is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid 
fueled strap-on boosters.  The first stage (L220) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by 4 liquid fueled Viking V engines.  The second stage (L33)
is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the
Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages
use a biliquid UH25/N2O4 fuel. The third stage (H10) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by a cryogenic H2/O2 fueled HM-7B engine built by SEP. The two
strap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built 
by SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.  
The fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad.  
It uses the Type 01 Ariane Short payload fairing.

"NOTE:  followups to comp.dcom.modems (for obvious reasons)




the Courier is their top-of-the-line product, thus the higher price.  I've
never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what
I've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably
doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure
if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier
modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.

again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated
the Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you
want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find
people who HAVE worked with the Sportster.

personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd
buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this
is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right
now.

and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want
to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to
comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll
get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you
may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts
complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to
avoid spreading faulty info).


just as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in
either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only
operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is
currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary
mode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.

and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also
supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).


take a second look at the original question:

                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST
modem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier
V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it
therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.

also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb
version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are
even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.


HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about
HST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a
proprietary modulation scheme.


I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some
way.....

first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is
part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a
feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter
in the Courier DS manual).

second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an
asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed
in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,
and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if
you're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of
info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,
a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse
directions.

V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full
data rate in both directions at the same time.

third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with
symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.


again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable
to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large
footprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which
could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.

later.....

I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on
his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I
actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.

I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and
rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to
invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then
I also passed my road test.

On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a
4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),
I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,
skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the
oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was
also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under
a car and been killed.

Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the
Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training
could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater
since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff
as I did.

So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I
wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you
happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until
you're ready to use it.


While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in
DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you
save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,
plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure
the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up
machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration
and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not
including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.


I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200
in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial
coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be
poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo
more expensive.


There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle
magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or
recent models might be available.  You could probably look through
past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first
bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice
instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that
are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by
noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around
and they were generally set up the way I wanted.

Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting
showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,
were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and
quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence
cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.",tell story example not early 1984 take ride lesson college roommate old honda cb360 t take msf beginner course actually learn need know ride proceed buy beatup honda cl350 400 12 helmet ride around wear cotton windbreaker decide invest fullface helmet first smart move sometime around also pass road test may 4 1984 got catch rainstorm way home 4mile trip enter town live rather urban suburb stop suddenly red light notice late skid rear tire eject face upward oncoming lane traffic fortunately oncome traffic also stop red light otherwise might slid car kill anecdotal evidence sure later take experienced rider course msf see early training could help greatly case need even great since nobody help practice even basic stuff advice take msf beginner course first thing not even buy bike take course unless happen pick real good deal store someplace ready use wait take course might take week dc recall always wait list boston could save money start right say 300 ride gear plus cost bike plus maybe 100 guess mechanic make sure machine safe assume economize buy old beatup machine private individual plus insurance plus registration licensing fee plus course look maybe 600 not include bike reserve ongoing maintenance pay 100 insurance upstate ny close 200 boston urban decent insurance include substantial coverage liability want unless plan always poor would guess dc like boston like rural area ergo expensive use annual buyer guide usual motorcycle magazine find helpful get idea new recent model might available could probably look past issue size use bike might available first bike 13 year old buy go friend advice instead also look bike see people ride park street basically settle present bike noticing lot highmileage bmw run around generally set way want nothing wrong talk various dealer area visit showroom dealer boston area least shop nice letting look around showroom quote price bike not late model hence cheaper although end buying bike private sale,1,rec.motorcycles

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the
menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in
PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called. 

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred
them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)
or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).",bet suddenly start stick start leave pc running menu night limitationbug date rollover software pc mean something like wait keyboard input via do call rather bio call menu often use otherwise code update date midnight never gets call somebody might able correct detail case misrememberre think change menu program source add tsr system patch something far know cmos clock keep right time fact 7 secondsday well do clock,0,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Also remember, that the presence of a repair/supply facility adds value
to the space around it. If you can put your satellite in an orbit where it

I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK, but is unhookable
to anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy
diagonal noise. 
I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board
(double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector
with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT
to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to
be of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or
setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.

Phil> Didn't one of the early jet fighters have these?  I also think
Phil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.

The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly
descended from the NACA, with space added in.

You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the
X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one
dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't
change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity
of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s
have sweep wings.


Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...

After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams
demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley
Research Center, were giants in the field.

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was
bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts.

Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No
mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.
General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how
successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both
fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)

Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!  

The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other
hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
can't do.

This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into
the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There
was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of
state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.
The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was
mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that
many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with
low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for
travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a
university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well
as salary.

During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure
scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they 
were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is
probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try
to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution
emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to
discussion about their problems, the job got done.

The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the
future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was
unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the
future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as 
NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly
keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,
making it more difficult for them to act to support research.

The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which
the government supports research the university will not provide funding,
and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,
as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of
a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask
for one?  The answer I will get is, ""Get the money from NSF.""  Now the
money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it
comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from
getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects
get supported, and how much.  

Also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread.  So instead
of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research
institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into
being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating
reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal
has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals
already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am
proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find 
impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow
I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea
which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to
something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, 
and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it
is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring 
more than minimal attention of a good researcher.  

I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would
have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government
is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.",definitely nothing entry government support science relevant technology little involvement federal fund except support state university state fund scientific research wwii we research position grow steadily fund mainly university private foundation fund not many research university provide researcher low teaching load laboratorie assistant equipment fund travel scientific meeting not much provide university wishing get scholar consider research funding well salary wwii military defense department find pure scientist could quite well problem even though not exactly area scientist expertise probably research mind approach not try find solution understand problem see solution emerge work stage research scientist use discussion problem job got do military realize importance maintain scientist future start fund pure research wwii congress unwilling military fund divert investment future supply scientist set organization nsf job also set elaborate procedure supposedly keep politic also government job private foundation make difficult act support research bad part federal involvement area government support research university not provide funding fact expect scholar bring net government money suppose case project could use assistance graduate student month think happen ask one answer get get money nsf money university level thousand nsf level come 20 thousand likely keep faculty member getting support government effect decide project get support much also government decide wealth spread instead moderate number university primarily research institution idea school get act come instead evaluate scholar go evaluate reseach proposal researcher tell research proposal mainly wishful thinking happen investigator conceal already do work release result research propose today may solve funding grant may find impossible may find difficult addition tomorrow may get unexpected research result possibly may bet bright idea solve yesterday difficult problem whole new approach something not consider develop nature beast except really vague statement something predict not major research development routine activity not require minimal attention good researcher believe time less quality research do would happen government never get government try divert researcher thinker plodder,2,sci.space

   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the 
peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I
was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway 
documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.
The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came
with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)
was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and 
has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly
even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a 
lot to do with it. 

   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about
some people having problems with high speed serial communications. 
I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old
computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then ""maps"" the other
machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can ""cd"" to these
drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a
peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.
It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this
machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the 
peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. 

  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also
by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430

RELEASE:  93-76

HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS

	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to
service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day
mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability
for an additional two, if needed.

	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was
reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times
required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual
EVA tasks on previous missions.

	""Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is
to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the
dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,"" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.
""It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added
flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.""

	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the
spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays
and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective
Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives
during the mission.

	""When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through
lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,
WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each
spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,"" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight
Director for the mission.

	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two
alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than
previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.

	""We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous
spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,""
Heflin said.  ""In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to
formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible
to accomplish the mission objectives.""

	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions
that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated
simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone
underwater training ""runs"" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.

	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be
made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the
mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight
will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.

	Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include
spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.
The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the
actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at
the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,
Huntsville, Ala.

	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining
further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the
experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and
trainers.

	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with
grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.

Well, I'll avoid your question for now (got some learnin' to do) with a
promise to come back with more info when I can find it.  I _do_ know that
BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of
long-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the all-sky map's accuracy.  PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of ""fractions of a degree"", if that's 
any help.

Speaking of GRO, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps
for orbit adjust appear to be going well.  Our branch guy who's helping
out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the
burns will take place in mid-June.

I already tried our national news group without success.

	HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55

It's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding day
of spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Grab
all your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium
or better.  Head out.

	In Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of
Gilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.
Having just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it
for a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, I
went into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,
and started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt
just right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a
bit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mph
grab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail
to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist
the throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see
just how well she's been put back together.

	At 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was
flexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my
helmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny
pack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper
pulled in all hot and flustered.

	""Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?""
""Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,
not the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, and
I'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic.""
	""My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me why
I shouldn't give you a ticket?""
""Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and
traffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective
gear that safety demands?"" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent)
	""Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?""
<I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike>
	""Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years.""
<compare riding stories>
<pack toolkit, having tightened that fender>
	""So why were you out here?""
""I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through
me.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead.  If it holds
up out here, then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do this
evvery year when I rebuild her.""
	""Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highway
to do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway
again I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now get
out of my sight before I write you a ticket.""
""Yes, officer.""
	""And kid, keep your eyes open out there..."" <drives off>

	And that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be
loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com
will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.


mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.
The working of both drivers is totally the same.

When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,
because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the
ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,
because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

"DS>From: viking@iastate.edu (Dan Sorenson)


DS>>Riding up the hill leading to my
DS>>house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to
DS>>the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to
DS>>the Spagthorpe Viking).

DS>        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking.  Was
DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front
DS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?

No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when
(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.
The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max
Friz's famous design, but with an overhead ""point cam"" (see below for
more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground
clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so
that the ground clearance was substantially increased:


      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)
                 Viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/

This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved
around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn
in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting
rods to accomodate the stroke.

The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still
unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and
and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was
required to drive both overhead valves.

Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a
pressurized stream of oil to power the ""waterwheel"" which kept the lobe
spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal
engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to
normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,
resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a
little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to
pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,
uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).

Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even
higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This
was feasible because it was a racing engine.

With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers
because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an
almost perfect point:

                    /\
                   /()\   <-lobe
                  / XX \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to
 valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity)
                |  |   | |
                |  |===| |
                    =0=  <---piston
                     |
                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical
                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the
                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the
                             curvature because there was none in the
                             head itself. The bore curve would start
                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                             this diagram


The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of
the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of
finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the
name.

The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it
worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that
racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines
were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate
(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two
Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and
down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as
twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern
record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle
historians discount this story.

 that might look like a dull request, but I have been following this newgroup
for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind.

  I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the
pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!).
The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It
gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only
problem is that it is quite slow.

I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot
of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall
picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody
direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.
I would like to get information about :
     - the refresh rates the various cards provide;
     - quality of windows drivers;
     - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff).

Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip 
info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied
with it,  let me know.

                               (can reach 70kHz horizontally)  

I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow
screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the
graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient
when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent 
enough to record settings.

In fact, you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring NASA 
altogether.  The rocket is a commercial launch vechicle - a Conestoga flying 
a COMET payload.  NASA is simply the primary customer.  I believe SDIO has a
small payload as well.  The advertising space was sold by the owners of the
rocket, who can do whatever they darn well please with it.  In addition, these
anonymous ""observers"" had no reason to be startled.  The deal made Space News
at least twice. 




I think its only fair to find that out before everyone starts having a hissy
fit.  The fact that they bothered to use the conditional tense suggests that
it has not yet been approved.

re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement 

Dear Chick:
      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the 
MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the
Owners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:

""Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.

    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's
statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with
the word ""undertiding"" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does
not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the 
process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.
     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an ""asshole"" you remind the
letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences.

I once thought it would be easiest fitting a sine to the times. But not.
This gave  discrepancy of upto six minutes. If you fit a sine series
you'll get a very good fit after just three or four terms though. This
presumably has to do with the eccentricity of the Earths orbit.

"Hi, I just have a small question about my bike. 
Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to 
think about my Honda. 
She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike 
week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and 
was running only on one cylinder. 
I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect 
working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look 
very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All 
still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a 
slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), 
but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for 
this bike. 
Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone 
the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in 
order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the 
wear of my pistons??

"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think
about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from 
Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated
at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to
the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay
pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used
a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.
	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front
fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube
frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to
do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two
vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing
follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.
The compressor is about 2"" in diameter and about 5"" long.
	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small
so there should be plenty of good places for it.
	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to
mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side
just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the
horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where
the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough
room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice
cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.
	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out
about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look
closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight
ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).
	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try
to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them
first.
	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound
more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.
I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has
not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).
	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though
they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping
the pedestrians on the sidewalk.
The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to
those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)
and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

: p.s.  I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or
: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)

I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation
for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-
modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't
really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial
I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,
but you should still check your software!

I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA
Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the
connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is
a ""DB-25"" but IBM has set an alternative ""standard"" of DB-9.  The primary
signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).
There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.
For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an
output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)
signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's
five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)
signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used
to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok
via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input
to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)
are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs
to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -
a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.
DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the ""connection"" has been established
i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh
there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have
explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:

Name    DB-9     DB-25
 SG       5        7
 TD       3        2
 RD       2        3
DTR       4       20
DSR       6        6
DCD       1        8
RTS       7        4
CTS       8        5
 RI       9       22

Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE
to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232
signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert
the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,
and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other
end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just
send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would
include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the
software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-
ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the
serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-
Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The
only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also
fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And
that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the
DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the
DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by
asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can
send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow
control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,
one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no
wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF
commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because
your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract ""escape""
codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-
ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to
do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair
game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.
But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,
I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control
the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the
clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a
differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS
signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-
ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the
RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting
the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more
""gotcha"" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to
see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the
DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but
the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And
of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must
pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,
if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not
specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use
this one.

"I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent 
experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. 

I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot, that
is, if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on
hard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over the
inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving
Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and 
luggage.

Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit 
off the back is hard to fight. Similarly, I held on to the grab handles
tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'm
a lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the 
tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for 
him to manage.

On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself, I absolutely
refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That's
helmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's 
not my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility
to require it if they want to ride.

And I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience
carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried
many passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before
you head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton. That's a

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
the car in front, but enough to manuver around it.  Keep the bike in
1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for
engaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.

When the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it, or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine.  Do is smoothly, just
rapidly.  The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection
than anything else (particularly empty road).

coolant available. After 100,000 miles of testing, they find
it has a boiling point of 365 degrees (much higher than
conventional coolants)- which helps elminate detonation and 
pinging, it allows the use of smaller radiators in race cars,
it will not damage aluminum blocks or heads, and it is 
environmentally safe. Yep, this is the good stuff.

I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the major
problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion
reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so
small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some
fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would
have to be processed.

This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon
as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't
content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,
average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the
market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.
This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.

On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11
and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...
terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in
titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and
sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are
*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the
world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If
even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2
at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti
basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being
mined today).",site major commercial activity far know material not get cheap right earth asteroid comet aside semimythic he3 might useful low grade fusion reactor not know low grade fusion reactor major problem 3he aside difficulty make fusion reactor work concentration lunar regolith small order 5 ppb average fraction still small massive amount regolith would process thread remind wingo claim time ago moon source titanium use earth recall wingo not content assure titanium 5 earth crust average would not run tout lunar mine even though market price ilmenite concentrate day around 06pound prompt look large potential terrestrial source moon titanium occur basalt highti basalt apollo 11 17 814 titanium dioxide weight nice terrestrial continental flood basalt also typically enrich titanium often 3 tio2 frequently 4 sometimes even 5 tio2 weight flood basalt enormous million cubic kilometer scatter world siberia brazil nw united state ethiopia etc even 1 basalt 5 tio2 trillion ton tio2 concentration factor 23 less lunar highti basalt difficult see disadvantage moon could overcome small increase concentration ore never mind richer less common terrestrial ore mine today,2,sci.space

But you already can go at the speed limit at 4000 rpm.  All you need
to do is to find a road with a 35 mph speed limit.

This isn't quite as silly as it sounds.  If you take a nice day trip
over back roads (*not* highways full of people trying seriously to get

"Two developments have brought these type of activities back to
the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a
20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from
the Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank,
NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner
reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-
based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV
commercial, as filmed from the Mir.
   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the
same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga
booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""Environmental
Billboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the
University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""Environmental
Billboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,
deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.
   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for
maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone reading
sensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's
delicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head of
SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns,
it will release ozone-building components that will literally
replenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitor
the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns
up and ""adds to the ozone supply.""
   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several
millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI
estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who
watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost
$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being
promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
  
But back to Brian's questions:
  
    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my
estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus
$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to
tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for
optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon
someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated
launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.
    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as
well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use
of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the
legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,
and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light
pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal
challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive
aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the
advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change
positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the
space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an
idiot?)
   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low
enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would
only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before
dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just
after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time
of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still
be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)
    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There
were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga
advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for
only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding
for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking
for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I
am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.
  
   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be
my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least
I don't THINK I do...).

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

I totally agree with your friend, since when the CPU is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
(checking for keyboard input for instance).  

The exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops, where the CPU can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing.  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again.

   Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By 
   the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, 
   the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round
   trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as
   5000 kg in a Low Earth ""advertising"" orbit: Very roughly the
   same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were
   to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...

This is nonsense.  Its like saying that by the time commercials
on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own
hour long nationally broadcast TV program.

   There's always been a problem of having to get 
   away from civilization before you can really find ""natural""
   scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip
   of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles
   or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards
   on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still
   ""wild."" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital
   billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of 
   growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will
   not save your view of the night sky, because by the time 
   such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
   finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_
   the stars...

The rest of your post is strange mishmash of ""its already really bad""
and ""it doesn't really matter if it gets worse.""  You should try to
figure out what you are really arguing for.  (Kneejerk anti-environ-

"   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
years ago.  The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in
Washington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The
State Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien
invaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens),
the Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was
very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything
intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a
philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I
believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral
person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.

   I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The
human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does
underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The
usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the
culture.  This may not always be wrong, but that's the way to bet.

The '84 GL1200A hit the traps at 13.34 according to Cycle magazine. Yeah,
they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then
they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for
just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost
16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.

Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. 
If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere
$2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to
depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the
knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-)

Well, here goes.

The first item of business is to establish the importance space life
sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared
to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested
or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can
make a major change in that lack of insight and education.

All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document
which can be released to the general public around the world.  The
document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long
term human habitation in space.

I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to 
succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld
(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,
chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created
to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.

So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective
methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies
which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed
literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates
and clearly important to existing space programs.

In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into
various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.

"It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible
486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:
And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.

The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX
socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.
the 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any
software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the
coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the
actual coprocessor.

The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit
rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance
boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a
386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and
QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,
is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is
around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,
and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2
compatibility, but I didn't test it.

The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually
a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains
the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX
PGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board
doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when 
access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available
from Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20
only.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.
If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need
to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...

I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K
external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still
significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.

IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or
can't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,
but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure
about the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't
beat it in any significant way.

The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,
asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:

Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.
1-800-677-9781
The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00

But....

I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.
If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you
more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,
So I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions
regarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.

It's my understanding that the freezing will start to occur because of the
growing distance of Pluto and Charon from the Sun, due to it's
elliptical orbit. It is not due to shadowing effects. 


Pluto can shadow Charon, and vice-versa.

If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that

choice of newsgroups 'interesting'.  Perhaps someone should tell this

It's truly frightening that posts like this are originating at what

wonder that the rest of the world thinks we're all nuts and that we

"Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working
on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with
Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU
with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and 
Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong
with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to
access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C
code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that
will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.

I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code
that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I
am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack
of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.
I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and
then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, 
the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do
nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses
the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt
int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )
the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )
and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as
to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?
